The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has recommended increasing the ex-depot price of petrol and HSD by Rs37 per litre for the first half of August based at Rs55 per litre petroleum levy (PL) on petrol and Rs50 PL on HSD. No general sales tax (GST) has been incorporated in the prices. The Finance Division did not announce the fortnightly adjustment in the prices of petroleum products on Monday, as consultations continued till Tuesday morning. Explaining the delay, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said that the government had checked the recommendations of the OGRA until the late hours of the night. “The basic reason for the delay in the announcement was that we were looking at different ways to reduce the prices,” Dar said. The finance minister announced an increase in the prices of petrol and HSD by Rs19.95 and Rs19.90 per litre, respectively. The price of petrol has soared to Rs272.95 per litre, while the HSD price reached at Rs273.40 per litre. This significant price surge is likely to hit the already burdened consumers hard.

The inland freight equalization margin (IFEM) has been declined by Rs1.36 per litre on HSD and fixed at Rs2.63 per litre on petrol. These are based on the provisional costs of PSO cargos completely discharged between July-16-31, whereas, the value of custom duty has been taken as communicated by OGRA. However, no HSD cargo was imported by PSO during the period. Last week, the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) had written letters to the OGRA asking to raise the price of the HSD by Rs10 to Rs12 per litre for the first half of August as it faced massive losses due to higher import costs and lower domestic prices.

This was stated by finance minister Miftah Ismail addressing a press conference on Sunday. He said that as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif believes the people cannot be further burdened at this point in time, today he would not increase the price, so there is no need to form long queues at petrol stations. He; however, made it clear that adjustment in petroleum prices would be inevitable in days ahead because government was providing Rs120 billion monthly subsidy and there is no sign of reduction in the crude oil prices in the international market. As the discussion with the IMF would start from May 18, 2022, he would try to seek leniency or a middle way on petroleum price from the Fund, he added. Finance Minister strongly criticized the previous government over slashing by Rs 10 per litre petrol and diesel in last days of its tenure and stated that they had caused great harm to the economy and now the situation has further worsened with the increase in crude oil price in the global market from US$90 per barrel at that time to US$110 barrel now. He also maintained that the previous government had not funded the subsidy on petroleum products. Shaukat Tarin committed to the IMF that not a penny subsidy would be provided and promised to the Fund that Rs 30 petroleum levy would be collected and Rs 17 percent GST would be imposed, he said. Miftah Ismail said that in December 2021, Shaukat Tarin had also promised to the IMF to limit the primary deficit at Rs 25 billion for the ongoing fiscal year but actually it has increased to Rs 1320 billion, which in no way the present government be able to comply in two-month time. Miftah Ismail has also claimed that the EFF programme was ended by the IMF, but he, soon after assuming the office, went to the IMF to restart discussion and when Fund sought political commitment, he proposed extension of one year in the programme as well as US$ 2 billion increase in loan amount. He said that talks with staff level IMF mission would begin from May 18 2022 and Secretary Finance would be heading the Pakistani delegation in talks initially and he would also join them. He said that the country would remain in the IMF programme. Finance Minister said that Pakistan has become wheat and sugar importing country during the last three and half years because of smuggling of wheat, flour and urea, as well as, use of fake pesticide. He said that during the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) tenure the country was exporting wheat and sugar. He said this year the country would be importing three million tonnes of wheat and as chairmen of the ECC of the Cabinet he has already given approval last week in this regard. The minister said that cotton production was 5.3 million bales last year, lowest after 1983-84; whereas this year the production is projected at 07 million bales compared to 10.17 million bales of in the last year of his party’s government. He said that in all the three major crops Pakistan production was less. He said one would of course be asking the question whether suspicious officials who were facing serious charges of corruption and 0.14 million tons smuggling of urea were behind the decline in production of agriculture sector. He said that without the help and involvement of Punjab government, smuggling of urea was not possible and on top of that those flour mills which were provided thousands of tonnes of flour, did not consume any electricity which implies that those flour mills had not done milling and sold the wheat to Afghanistan. He said that the government was providing subsidized gas to the fertilizer companies. He said that agriculture sector was a low hanging fruit but Pakistan is importing edible oil, cotton and wheat and this year the country would be facing Rs35 billion trade deficit and current account deficit of over $15 billion as exports would be $30 billion and remittance $30 billion. He said that commodity prices have significantly increased during three and half years of previous government primarily because of devaluation of rupee, flawed economic policies. He said of course increase in international prices was also one of the factors. He said that the Covid was a shock for the economy; however, it was good financially for the country because the country was recipient of $4 billion because G20 countries had not asked for repayment and IMF provided $1.5 billion emergency fund and the country also borrowed from global level but the government did not provide relief to the people during that time. The government has neither increased tax to GDP ratio not reduced expenditure. He said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government added Rs 20,000 billion debt during the last three and half years compared to total Rs 24,952 billion accumulated by all the government since 1947 to 2018.

It further proposed Rs20.81 per litre increase in ex-refinery price of high speed diesel (HSD). The new recommended price of HSD was Rs207.40 per litre against present Rs186.59 per litre. Energy sources said that expected price differential claim (PDC) payable on kerosene oil (SKO) to refineries would be Rs43.17 per litre for the period and recommended price increase is Rs162.80 per litre from current Rs119.63 per litre.

The regulator had proposed an increase in the price of HSD by Rs51.32 per litre (35.7 percent increase), petrol by Rs21.30 per litre (14.2 percent increase), kerosene oil by Rs36.03 per litre (28.7 percent increase), and light diesel oil (LDO) Rs38.89 per litre (39.9 percent increase). However, the premier had turned down the proposed increase in oil prices that would put an additional burden of around Rs63 billion in the shape of subsidy and revenue shortfall. The government would have to pay this amount to oil firms on account of price differential claims (PDCs). The State Bank of Pakistan already had revisited oil industry credit lines by allowing oil industry to meet the import petroleum products in the country. An amount of Rs30 billion is already due on account of price differential claims due to keeping oil prices unchanged from April 1, 2022.

Similarly, he said that the government has decided to reduce electricity tariff by Rs5 per unit, which means the electricity bill would be reduced by 20 to 25 percent. He said that the government had decided not to increase prices of oil and electricity till the next budget. He said that subsequent to Ukraine war, the prospect of decrease in oil prices is not expected. He said that the oil prices are lowest in Pakistan compared to other countries. He asked the opposition, which was criticizing the government on petrol prices, how they would reduce the oil prices. He said Rs70 billion subsidy is being provided; otherwise, petrol price would be over Rs210 per litre. The Prime Minister announced 100 percent tax exemption for both companies and freelancers in the IT sector, 100 percent foreign exchange exemption, and 100 percent exemption from capital gain tax for investments in IT startups. The premier said that no question would be asked for industrial investment, adding the details of industrial policy would be shared with the media today (Tuesday) at Lahore. The policy envisages revival of sick units through tax benefits and to attract overseas investment (joint ventures) tax holiday would be available for five years. He said Rs1 million free medical cover under Qaumi Sehat Card will be there for all citizens by end of March, 2022. It will help private medical hospitals to increase services in rural areas, he added. He said that stipend is increased from Rs12,000 to Rs14,000 per month for Ehsaas and graduate internship stipend will be Rs30,000 per month. He said that 2.6 million scholarships would be provided with allocation of Rs38 billion. He also recounted that his government inherited historic current and fiscal deficits and this was followed by coronavirus and country’s growth rate was -04 percent and after the country was coming out of the lockdown there was a super cycle of commodity fuelling the inflation in the country. The prime minister said that 70 percent electricity was being generated through imported fuel. He said that the US faced highest inflation during the last 40 years followed by Canada that faced 30 years’ highest. He said that during the PTI government, inflation was around eight percent. He said that Pakistan GDP growth was 5.6 percent despite the difficult situation, and the country was recipient of highest remittance of $31 billion and exports were also the highest, while the exports had not grown during the PML-N tenure. He said that Pakistan’s tax collection was more than Rs6000 billion and four major crops’ production was highest because the farmers received additional Rs1.1 trillion. He said that the LSM growth was 7.4 percent and big companies have earned huge profits. Credit disbursement was highest and the construction sector received investment of Rs1500 billion. “I have to speak to you because the situation is changing very swiftly across the world. First, I wanted to start with the foreign policy and recently, I visited China and Russia. It was my desire to have an independent foreign policy for the benefit of the country,” he said, adding he was always against supporting the US in war against terror because it caused $50 billion d economic loss besides the loss of 80,000 lives, and the most shameful thing was that there were over 400 drone attacks. More than 400 drone attacks were done during the democratic governments of Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), he said. He said that the country was unable to adopt an independent foreign policy because ‘the leaders’ have stashed money in foreign bank accounts. He said that the people must not cast vote for the party whose leaders had banks accounts abroad. He said that Russian money was being frozen by the Western capitals. We have to import 20 lac tons’ wheat and would also to import gas, he said. The Prime Minister that the PECA law was made in 2016 and the present government wanted to amend it. He said that the government was not afraid of criticism but this law was being brought to deal with the bad things happening in the society. He said 94,000 cases are with the FIA, mostly for targeting household women and only a few cases have been decided and even the prime minister was not being spared and in fake news even the prime minister was not getting justice. He said the same journalist who had written about the corruption of Nawaz Sharif was put behind bars for three days by the former PM Nawaz and was also beaten up. A media house claimed that Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital money was being diverted to the PTI, he said. He said that in the name of freedom of journalists, a mafia was blackmailing the people; whereas, the true journalists would be happy for this kind of action against fake news. The PM also made comparison of his government with the four tenures of PPP governments from 1971 onwards and of three tenures of the PML-N governments, and stated that inflation during the present government was relatively less than the inflation during the tenures of those previous governments.","Reprising populist rhetoric, PM cuts rates of POL products, power",149.86,144.15,0.1,0.4,0.3,0.15,0.05,0.15,0.5,0.2,0.1,0.05,0.05,0.6,0.35,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.25,0.1,0.05,0.0,0.35,0.7,1.4,0.6
