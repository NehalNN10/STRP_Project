The federal government on
Saturday increased the price
of petrol by Rs3.72 per litre
in line with fluctuation in
global oil prices effective
Dec 1 (today).
It also hiked the price of
high speed diesel (HSD) by
R3.29 per litre. However,
the price of kerosene oil
has been slashed by Rs0.62
per litre and light diesel oil
(LDO) by Rs0.48 per litre.
The finance ministry in
a statement said that the
Oil and Gas Regulatory
Authority (Ogra) had
worked out the consumer
prices of petroleum prod-
ucts as per variation in the
oil price in the interna-
tional market.
The price of petrol has
witnessed an increase of
Rs3.72 per litre, going up
from Rs248.38 to Rs252.10
per litre.
The price of HSD has
also been raised by Rs3.29
per litre, from Rs255.14 to
Rs258.43 per litre, due to
fluctuation in global oil
prices.
Petrol is used in motor-
bike and cars and its de-
mand has increased since
the government cut indig-
enous gas supplies to CNG
retail outlets in Punjab sev-
eral years ago.
CNG stations in Punjab
now use imported gas, the
price of which is double
that of indigenous gas. As
a result, CNG has become

uncompetitive in the province.
HSD is primarily used in the
transport and agriculture sectors.
Therefore, fluctuations in its price
will have a direct inflationary im-
pact on consumers.
Likewise, the price of kerosene oil
has come down by Rs0.62 per litre
from Rs165.60 to Rs164.98 per litre
and LDO by Rs0.48 from Rs152.21 to
Rs151.73 per litre.
Kerosene oil is used in remote
areas, especially in the northern
parts of the country, where LPG is
not available for cooking purposes.
The Pakistan Army is its key user
in the northern region due to the
cold weather. LDO is used in the
industrial sector.
The oil prices also include the
Inland Freight Equalization
Margin (IFEM), set at Rs7.50 per
litre for petrol and Rs4.15 per litre
for HSD.
The premium on petrol is $9.80
per barrel. This premium rate ap-
plies to the import of petrol and is
higher than usual, contributing
to the proposed increase in the
price of petrol. In the last review,
the government adjusted the
increase in oil prices within the
IFEM, rather than passing it on to
the general public, to mitigate the
inflationary impact.
The government is currently im-
posing a petroleum levy of Rs60
per litre on both petrol and HSD,
a high rate that consumers are
paying to help cover the country's
current expenditures.
Meanwhile, Ogra has announced
a marginal increase in Liquified
Petroleum Gas (LPG) prices for
Dec, citing fluctuations in the
exchange rate as a contributing
factor. According to a statement

from Rs163.02 per litre.
Likewise, the price of light-
diesel oil was also reduced
by Rs2.61 from Rs150.12 to
Rs147.51 per litre.
Petrol is mainly used in
private transportation,
small vehicles, rickshaws,
and two-wheelers. Higher
fuel prices significantly
impact the budgets of the
members of the middle
and lower-middle classes,
who primarily consume
petrol for commuting.
On the other hand, a sig-
nificant portion of the
transport sector relies on
high-speed diesel.
Its price is considered
inflationary since it is pre-
dominantly used in heavy
goods transport vehicles,
trucks, buses, trains, and
agricultural machinery
such as tractors, tube wells,
and threshers.
The government has an-
nounced that the prices
of petrol and High-Speed

unchanged for the next
fortnight.
""The OCRA has worked out
the prices of petroleum prod-
ucts for the next fortnight

by Finance Division.
The prices of petrol and
HSD will remain at Rs248.38

Rs1.35 and HSD by Rs3.85 per

Despite a rising trend in international oil
prices, the government kept the petrol
price unchanged, while it jacked up high
speed diesel (HSD) price by Rs5 per litre for
the next fortnight.
With an increase of Rs5 per litre, the price
of diesel goes up from Rs246.29 per litre to
Rs251.29 per litre, while the petrol price has
been maintained at Rs247.03 per litre.
In view of fluctuation in global oil
prices, the prices of diesel and petrol were
projected to be hiked up to Rs10 and Rs4
respectively.
High speed diesel is widely used in
the transport and agriculture sectors.
Therefore, the latest hike in its price may
have an inflationary impact on consumers.
The petrol is mostly used in motorbikes
and cars. Due to the ban on the use of in-
digenous gas in Punjab province, the de-
mand for petrol has swollen.

The price of HSD, also smuggled in large quanti- ties from Iran, has seen a substantial reduction of Rs13.06 per liter, bringing its price down to Rs249.69 per liter from Rs262.75 per liter. HSD is widely used in the transport and agricul- ture sectors, and its price cut is expected to help ease inflation.
The reduction in global oil prices has been driven by a surplus in supply relative to demand and economic concerns in China and the United States. OPEC, the cartel of oil-producing countries, has also delayed its decision regarding a planned output increase, contributing to the con- tinued decline in global oil prices.
Kerosene oil, now priced at Rs158.47 per liter com- pared to the previous Rs169.62 per liter, has been reduced by Rs11.15 per liter. Kerosene is commonly used in remote areas, especially in northern Pakistan, where LPG is unavailable for stoves. The Pakistan Army is also a significant consumer of kerosene in these regions.

Prime Minister Shehbaz
Sharif has approved a cut
in the price of diesel by
Rs10.86 per litre, effective
from August 1, 2024, in line
with the decrease in global
oil prices.
 The price of petrol has

national market.
 The prices of Motor Spirit
and HSD for the next fort-
night, starting from August

The ministry said the
price of HSD has been re-
duced to Rs272.77 per litre
from Rs283.63, marking a
decrease of Rs10.86 per litre.
 Since HSD is used in the
agriculture and transport
sectors, reduction in its

price is expected to have
an inflationary impact on
consumers.
 The price of petrol has
been reduced to Rs269.43
per litre from Rs275.60
per litre, registering a de-
crease of Rs6.17 per litre.
 Petrol is used in motor-
bikes and cars. It is consid-
ered an alternative to CNG,
particularly in Punjab,
where CNG retail outlets
operate on imported LNG.
 The price of kerosene
oil has been slashed to
Rs177.39 per litre from Rs
183.71 per litre, register-
ing a cut of Rs6.32 per litre.
 Kerosene oil is primarily
used for cooking in areas
where liquefied petro-
leum gas (LPG) is unavail-
able. It is widely used in
the northern regions of
the country, with the
Pakistan army being its
major consumer.
 The price of LDO has
been reduced to Rs160.53
per litre from Rs166.25 per
litre, marking a decrease
of Rs5.72 per litre. LDO is
used primarily in industry.
 The government has
been charging a petroleum
levy of Rs60 per litre on
both petrol and HSD.
 Additionally, it is charg-
ing a petroleum levy of
Rs0.05 per litre on kero-
sene oil. However, no
petroleum levy is being
charged on LDO.
 The government had set
an ambitious target for
collecting petroleum
from oil consumers dur-
ing the current financial
year. As a result, the petro-
creased further to enhance
revenue collection.
 The collection of sales
tax on these products is
zero. Revenue from sales
tax goes to the provinces
while the petroleum levy
is directed into federal
coffers.
 Therefore, the federal
government increased
the petroleum levy rate
to boost revenue while
keeping the sales tax rate
on petroleum products at
zero.
 Meanwhile, Ogra an-
nounced an increase of
Rs2.28 per kilogramme in

According to a finance ministry notification, petrol prices rose by Rs9.99 per litre, while high-speed diesel (HSD) increased by Rs6.18 per litre for the next fortnight starting from midnight Monday. The ministry notification said that fuel charges had been increased because of price variations in the international market worked out by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra). ""Ogra has worked out consumer prices based on international market price fluctuations,"" said the notification. It clarified that there would be no changes in the applicable duties and levies, which will remain at the current level.

Accordingly, the new price of petrol was fixed at Rs275.6 per litre from the previous Rs265.61 and diesel Rs283.63 per litre, up from the previous Rs277.45. Two weeks earlier, the government had increased the fuel prices after a decline in three preceding revisions. 
After offering relief to consumers in the last three revisions of oil prices, the federal government increased the prices of petroleum products by up to Rs9.56 per litre on Monday in view of fluctuations in the global fuel prices. 

The upward revision of the fuel prices came a day after the government notified a substantial increase in electricity tariffs, affecting millions of consumers across the country, particularly the residential users.

After offering relief to consumers in the last three revisions of oil prices, the federal government increased the prices of petroleum products by up to Rs 9.56 per litre on Sunday in view of fluctuations in the global fuel prices.

The new rates are taking effect on the first day of a tax-laden budget. According to a notification, the price of petrol was raised by Rs7.45 per litre, while the high-speed diesel (HSD) went up by Rs 9.56 per litre.

The finance ministry issued the notification regarding the increase in petroleum product prices, saying that the new prices would take effect from Monday (today) and remain in place for the next 15 days.

The price of petrol had been increased from Rs258.16 to Rs265.61 per litre, while the price of HSD was increased from Rs267.89 to Rs277.49 per litre, according to the notification.

Sources said the price of light diesel had also been increased by Rs9.88 per litre, and the price of kerosene oil had been jacked up by Rs 10.05 per litre.

The increase in petroleum product prices has been made based on the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority's (Ogra) recommendations and with the prime minister's approval.

The increase announced in the budget for the petroleum development levy has not been included in these prices; rather the rise is due to the increase in oil prices in the international market.

The government is charging a Rs 60 per litre petroleum levy on petrol and HSD, whereas they are exempt from the general sales tax (GST).

In case the government decides to raise the levy on both petrol and HSD by Rs5 per litre, the prices of petrol and HSD would go up further by Rs12.54 and Rs14.84 per litre, respectively.

The Finance Bill 2024 has proposed a maximum petroleum levy limit of Rs80 per litre, aiming to collect Rs1.28 trillion in the new fiscal year, up from the outgoing fiscal year estimates of Rs869 billion.

Over the past fortnight, international prices for petrol and HSD have surged by approximately $4.4 and $5.5 per barrel, respectively. Premium on petrol is calculated at $9.590 per barrel and $6.50 per barrel, same as the previous review.

HSD is widely used in the transport and agriculture sectors.

After an initial confusion about the fuel rates caused by the premier's ""directives"" that was hurriedly clarified, the government on Friday slashed the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs4.74 and Rs3.84 per litre, respectively.

The Finance Division, which usually issues a notification for the new prices of the petroleum products by 11:30 pm, was unable to release it this time until 12:35 am.

The new prices have been implemented from Saturday (today) and will remain unchanged for the next 15 days.

After the reduction, the new price of petrol is Rs268.36 per litre against its previous rate of Rs273.10. Similarly, HSD will be available for Rs270.22 per litre instead of its earlier price of Rs274.08.

""The prices of petroleum products have seen a de- creasing trend in the inter- national market during the last fortnight,"" the notification read.

      ""The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has worked out the consumer prices, based on the price variations in the inter- national market,"" it added. The prices of kerosene oil and light diesel oil (LDO) have also been reduced by Rs1.87 and Rs 3.88 per litre for the next 15 days.

After the reduction, kerosene oil will cost Rs171.61 per litre against its earlier price of Rs 173.48. Likewise, LDO will be available for Rs157.29 per litre after the cut instead of its previous rate of Rs161.17.

It should be noted that earlier on Friday, the state-run PTV on social media platform X carried Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's directives to the finance ministry to reduce the prices of petrol and HSD by Rs15.40 and Rs7.90 per litre respectively.

Moments later, a clarification was issued by the PM's Office and the post was deleted.

However, there was a massive gap between the prices announced in the ""so-called"" PM's statement and those notified by the Finance Division.

It is worth mentioning that the federal government had slashed the prices of petrol and HSD by Rs15.39 and Rs7.88 per litre, respectively for the second fortnightly of May as well.

The prices of kerosene oil and LDO had been reduced by Rs 9.86 and Rs 7.54 for the last

next fortnightly of May this year,

Notably, the price of crude oil has decreased in the inter- national market during the second fortnightly of May and currently roaming around $81 per barrel.

Effective from May 16 (Thursday), the new prices bring respite as petrol sees a decrease of Rs15.39 per litre, now priced at Rs273.1o0, while HSD experiences a dip of Rs7.88 per litre, with the new rate at Rs274.08.

The decision, outlined in a notification by the finance ministry, comes as a response to the recent downward trend in global petroleum prices. The ministry highlighted that the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) diligently computed consumer prices, aligning them with international market fluctuations.

New price applicable from May 16, to remain effective for next fortnight  

Petrol is used in motorbikes and cars and is considered an alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG) especially in Punjab province.

The CNG outlets in Punjab have been using imported gas for the last decade, therefore, the use of petrol has increased due to the shortage of gas.

But the oil industry claimed that smuggled petrol was being used by different units across the country, especially in Punjab and Sindh, noting that their sale did not witness a major increase.

The HSD is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors, therefore, reduction in its price is poised to have a significant impact on lowering inflation countrywide.

The government has slashed the price of kerosene oil by Rs9.86 per litre whereas that of light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs7.54 per litre.

Kerosene will now be sold at Rs173.48 per litre from Rs183.34 and LDO at Rs161.17per litre from Rs168.71. Kerosene is mainly used for cooking purposes in remote areas of the country, particularly in northern parts. It also an alternate to the LPG.

In the northern regions, the armed forces stand as a major consumer of LPG, utilising it extensively for heating and food preparation. LDO is mainly used in industries. At present, the government is charging Rs 60 per liter petroleum levy each on petrol and HSD. However, the rate of general sales tax (GST) is zero, The Centre had tactically increased the rate of petroleum levy to avoid sharing it with provinces.

The ministry notified the new reduced prices of petrol and diesel for the next fortnight. It did not notify the reduced prices of light diesel oil and kerosene for being deregulated. A separate notification was issued by Ogra for the decrease in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

According to the ministry, the new price of petrol is now Rs288.49 per litre, Rs 5.45 down from the previous Rs293.94. Similarly, high-speed diesel (HSD) will be available for Rs281.96 per litre, Rs8.42 down from previous rate of Rs290.38 per litre.

According to the notification, the new prices will be applicable from midnight Tuesday and remain valid for the next fortnight. In a statement, the ministry said that the prices of petroleum products had seen a decreasing trend in the international market during the last fortnight.

The price of kerosene and light diesel oil has also been reduced, officials said. They added that kerosene price had been reduced by Rs8.74 per litre and the LDO by Rs5.63 paisa per litre. However, since these prices had been de-regulated, these were not mention in the ministry notification.

Separately, Ogra notified Rs11.88 per kilogram decrease in the LPG price to Rs238.46 per kg for the month of May. Following the notification, the price of a domestic LPG cylinder witnessed a decline of Rs140 and the commercial cylinder of Rs539.

In April, the LPG price was fixed at Rs250 per kg and domestic cylinder was available at Rs2,954 and commercial cylinder at Rs11,366 in the open market. However, the domestic cylinder would now be available at Rs 2,814 and commercial cylinder at Rs 10,826.

The federal government raised the prices of petroleum products by up to Rs8.14 per liter on Monday due to fluctuations in global oil prices. The new prices will take effect from today, April 16, This marks the second price hike in petroleum products this month. According to a notification, the price of petrol has been raised by Rs4.53 per liter, from Rs289.41 to Rs293.94 per liter. The price of high-speed diesel (HSD) has also been increased by Rs8.14 per liter, from Rs282.24 to Rs290.38 per liter.

Earlier, the government raised the price of petrol by Rs 9.66 per liter on April 1. However, it reduced the price of HSD by Rs3.32 per liter for the first half of the month, effective from April 1 to 15.

Petrol is predominantly used in motorbikes and cars, with higher usage in Punjab due to CNG stations in the province relying on expensive imported gas rather than indigenous gas.

HSD finds extensive use in the transport and agriculture sectors. Therefore, the decision to increase its price is expected to have an inflationary impact on farmers and the general populace.

In a statement, the Ministry of Finance cited an increasing trend in international oil prices over the last fortnight as the reason for the price adjustment. It noted that the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) calculated consumer prices based on international market variations.

Presently, the government imposes a petroleum levy (PL) of Rs 6o per liter on almost all petroleum products. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is urging the government to levy a general sales tax (GST) of Rs18 per liter on petroleum products.

Currently, there is no GST on petroleum products. If implemented, this GST imposition would lead to further price hikes in the coming months.

The federal government strategically increased the petroleum levy rate as revenue collected through this levy goes to the federal treasury, while sales tax revenue goes to the provinces. Consequently, the sales tax rate has been reduced to zero to limit provincial revenue collection.

Oil and electricity consumers are seen as easy targets for taxation, with the government preferring to levy higher taxes on them rather than expanding the tax net.

Consumers may face increased taxes in the upcoming budget due to IMF pressure.

Petrol will now be available at Rs289.41 per litre against its previous price of Rs279.75 per litre.

Meanwhile, HSD will now cost Rs282.24 per litre instead of Rs285.56.

Justifying the hike, the finance ministry in a statement said the price of petrol had increased in the international market during the last fortnight while the rate of HSD had marginally declined.

It added that the government had accordingly decided to revise the existing prices of petroleum products from April 1.

The ministry further said the price adjustments were in line with the government's policy of passing on the variations of prices in the international market to the domestic one.

It said the consumer price of HSD had been accordingly decreased once again, after a downward revision in the middle of March this year.

Petrol is mainly used in cars and motorcycles.

Its use in Punjab is higher as CNG stations in the province lack the supply of indigenous gas. They are provided with expensive imported gas. HSD is widely used in transport and agricultural sectors. Therefore, the decision to cut its price will have a healthy impact on the farmers and other people as it may reduce the inflationary impact.

On Ogra's recommendation, the price of LPG has been reduced to Rs 250,341.58 per ton from Rs 256,790.16 per ton, registering a decline of Rs 6,448.58 per ton.

An LPG cylinder's price has been reduced from Rs 3,030.12 to Rs 2,954.03 for domestic consumers.

The government on Thursday increased gas tariff for residential users by up to 67% and up to 700% hike for fertiliser plants, while jacked up the prices of petroleum products by up to Rs8.37 per liter from Friday (today), in a move aimed at addressing the economic dynamics and ensuring stability in the energy sector.

The federal cabinet, in a meeting chaired by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, approved the gas price hike to recover additional Rs2q2 billion from all the consumers, in attempts to bring some equity in the rates of the fast depleting natural asset.

Immediately after the cabinet meeting, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) issued notification of the new gas prices, in accordance with the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) condition of raising the prices by Thursday, February 15.

Just before Thursday midnight, Finance Division notified that the price of MS (petrol) had been increased by Rs2.73 per litre, from Rs272.89 to Rs275.62. Similarly, the price of high speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs8.37 per litre, from R$278.96 per liter to Rs287.33. The Finance Division said that the decision came in line with the recommendations of Ogra. It added that the adjustment aimed at addressing the current economic dynamics and ensuring the stability of the energy sector in the country. It was the second time in the past three months that the gas tariff has been increased. The Ogra notification, showed that the hike would take effect from the February 1, and the new bills would be issued with revised rates. The decision puts an unreasonable burden on a class of residential consumers using more than 2 cubic hectometers (Hm3) gas for creating fiscal space to pay subsidies to other domestic consumers. The cabinet also finally took the much-delayed but needed decision to withdraw the Rs50 billion subsidies to a few fertilisers plants, which were earlier given preferential treatment by robbing the industrial consumers. Caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar played a pivotal role in the withdrawal of the fertiliser plants' subsidy, although the energy minister was in favour of continuing these subsidies. The fertiliser plants were availing these subsidies without passing on the benefit to the farmers. The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet held two rounds to approve these prices and finally took the decision on Wednesday. The federal cabinet ratified the ECC decision of February 14th, reads a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office after the cabinet meeting. It is the third increase in the prices that the consumer would bear amid double-digit inflation. The increase has thrown an additional burden of Rs242 billion on the consumers, including Rs37 billion that the government would earn in sales tax. It was also the second revision in the gas prices by the caretaker government in the past three months after it earlier increased the prices up to 1108% - the highest for the most vulnerable households.

Residential consumers The fresh revision also puts maximum burden on the most vulnerable households with a 67% or Rs100 increase per unit for the domestic monthly consumption of 0.5 cubic hectometers (Hm3). For other protected domestic consumers, the increase is in the range of Rs200 to Rs250 - also ranging from 25% to 67%.

The prices for non-protected residential consumers are either now close to the prescribed price of Rs1,597 per mmbtu or even higher than the prices of imported re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG). The rates for 1.5 Hm3 consumers have been increased to Rs1,450 - higher by 21%. The new prices for the 2 Hm3 monthly consumption consumers are Rs1,900-up by 19% - and Rs300 more than the cost of gas they need to pay. Similarly for the next slab of 3 Hms consumption, the new rate is Rs3,300 - close to the imported gas rate of Rs 3,750.

 The two highest residential slabs are charged rates that are even higher than the imported gas prices Rs3,800 and R$4,300. They are now forced to pay for the subsidies of other domestic consumers, which is unjustifiable. Earlier this month, OGRA is- sued a determination of revised estimated revenue requirements (RERR) for FY 2023-24 for both the SNGPL and the SSGCL. According to the revised determination, the SNGPL requires a revenue of Rs592 billion and the SSCCL requires a revenue of Rs310 billion this fiscal year, the total revenue requirement has been determined at Rs902 billion, arriving at an average prescribed price of Rs1,596 per mmbtu. The residential consumers of housing societies that buy gas in bulk will face a 45% increase in their prices. Their new rate is Rs2,900-up by Rs900 compared to current rates that too are just three months old. The fresh increase in prices is expected to further fuel the inflation that remains far higher than the goal set by the central bank. The inflation rate in January remained at 28.4% as against the annual target of 21%. Industrial Consumers The cabinet approved further increase in the gas prices for the in-house power generation of the industries for both the export and non-export sectors. Going forward, the cabinet has ended the distinction of the ex- port and non-export and a new uniformed rate for in-house gas plants has been set. The cabinet approved increase in the captive plants rates from Rs2,200 to 2,750 for exporters and from Rs2,500 to 2,750 for  local production - an increase, ranging from 10% to 25%. The Petroleum Division had proposed Rs2,950 per mmbtu rate, which was opposed by the industry minister. The Pakistan Textile Exporters Association (PTEA) Pattern- in-Chief Khurram Mukhtar emphasised the need for negotiating sustainable energy tariffs with the IMF and rationalising cross subsidies on industrial energy tariffs to support growth. ""Just raising energy tariffs is not going to work; strict enforcement requires reducing T&D losses and full bills recovery,"" said Mukhtar. ""Current hike in gas and electricity tariffs is disastrous for the economy and lacks any wisdom,"" he added. Fertiliser plants The caretaker cabinet has taken some corrective measures to stop the misuse of subsidy by the fer- tiliser plants. These plants were availing subsidised gas but were still selling expensive urea to the farmers. The cabinet approved increase  in the feed gas prices for Engro Fertiliser from Rs200 to Rs1,597 per MMBtu a surge of 700% that ends R$39 billion subsidies. The effective date for revised gas tariff for Engro Fertiliser is 1st March, 2024. It also approved increase in gas prices for Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBQL) from Rs580 to Rs1,597 mmbtu, showing an increase of 175% and ending its Rs10 billion subsidy. Agritech and Fatima Fertiliser are currently getting RLNG from SNGPL network. The cabinet approved increasing their prices by 29% to Rs1,597 per mmbtu, which is the average prescribed price in case these plants are offered system gas on SNGPL. The government still has to increase the gas prices for those fertiliser plants, which are availing the gas from the Mari Gas network. For the CNG sector, the government has increased the prices from Rs3,600 per mmbtu to R$3,750 per mmbtu equivalent to the RLNG price being the fuel for majority CNC producers in the country.",1199.0,275.62,287.33,"Homes hit, businesses reel as energy rates jacked up",0.0,0.01,0.1,0.6,0.29,0.0,0.05,0.1,0.45,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.45,0.5,0.0,0.05,0.2,0.47,0.28,-1.45,-0.98,-1.17,-1.2

The government on Wednesday implemented a significant hike in petrol prices by Rs 13.55 per litre for the fortnight starting February 1-15.

This increase primarily aims to cover elevated taxes for current expenditures and address the surge in global oil prices.

Additionally, the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) rose by Rs2.75 per litre, as stated by the finance ministry. Following this adjustment, petrol will now be priced at Rs272.89 per litre, up from Rs259.34, while diesel will cost Rs278.96 per litre, up from Rs276.21.

Petrol is predominantly utilized in motorbikes and cars, while diesel is essential in the transport and agriculture sectors. Fluctuations in the price of High-Speed Diesel (HSD) directly affect consumers, leading to inflationary pressures, With gas load-shedding affecting the CNG sector in February, petrol, often an alternative, is expected to witness high demand.

In Punjab, there is no indigenous gas available for the CNG sector for several years and the entire CNG sector is supplied imported gas. The CNG outlets in other provinces also face load-shedding due to gas shortages in the country.

""The government of Pakistan has decided to bring changes in the current prices of petroleum products during the fortnight starting from 1st February 2024, as recommended by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA),"" the finance ministry said in the statement.

 Pakistan is a net importer of petroleum products, therefore, premium on oil imports also reflects in the prices. Import premium on petrol is estimated at $9.47 per barrel, whereas, the premium on HSD has been estimated to increase to $6.50 per barrel from $5.30 per barrel. In the international market, the price of Brent had gone up by $5 per barrel to $83 from $78 per barrel on January 16. The HSD has also become costlier by about $2 per barrel to $97 from about $95 per barrel during the same period. At present, the government is charging higher rate of petroleum levy on petroleum products up to Rs 60 per litre. Therefore, the key reason of higher oil prices in Pakistan was the higher taxes, which the federal government was collecting to meet current expenditures. The Russia and Ukraine war was also another reason that had led to higher oil prices in the international market that affected the prices on domestic level.",390.0,272.89,278.96,Buckle up motorists: petrol surges by Rs13.55,0.0,0.05,0.1,0.6,0.25,0.0,0.05,0.25,0.5,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.5,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.55,0.35,0.1,-1.3,-0.55,-1.05,-0.85

The caretaker federal government has announced a significant reduction in the price of petrol by Rs 8 per litre, effective from today (Tuesday). The new price of petrol is now Rs259.34 per litre, down from the previous Rs267.34.

In contrast, the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) has been maintained at Rs276.21 per litre. The decision to keep diesel prices unchanged is attributed to an adjustment in the exchange rate at Rsi.50 and a premium of $5.30 per barrel.

The Finance Ministry, in a statement, underscored that these revisions align with the recommendations of the fuel regulator, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA).

The decision-making process considered various factors, including the petroleum levy (PL), general sales tax (GST), premium, exchange rate, and global oil prices.

The reduction in petrol prices is expected to lead to increased consumption, especially amid the ongoing gas crisis in the country. Petrol serves as an alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG) in vehicles, and the current situation may result in a surge in its usage.

Conversely, the unchanged price of diesel, crucial in the transport and agriculture sectors, may have implications for inflation.

The announcement does not include revisions for kerosene oil or light diesel oil (LDO), which were anticipated to see a decrease of Rs3 and Rs1.50 per litre, respectively.

Kerosene oil is widely used in stoves in remote areas where liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is not readily available, while LDO is an essential component in industries.

The decision-making process also took into account global oil market dynamics, with Brent Oil prices decreasing by $1.5 per barrel from $84.50 to $83 since January 1, 2024.

Additionally, the HSD rate experienced a modest reduction of ap- proximately $1 per barrel, falling from $97 to $95.80.

The prices of petrol and HSD will remain at Rs267.34 and Rs276.21 per litre, respectively.

Ogra has made the recommendation keeping in view the international oil prices.

The measure is aimed to mitigate potential financial burdens on consumers and maintain a stable economic environment, especially during this transitional period.

The calculations made by Ogra were largely based on a marginal increase in the prices of Brent crude and a slight drop in the Arab Gulf basket rates amid threats to shipping routes because of the Israeli war on Gaza.

Shehbaz claimed that the PML-N stands in unwavering solidarity with these op- pressed communities and condemns the injustices inflicted upon them by Israel and India. ‚ÄúIn this New Year, let our collective resolve extend beyond our borders, embrac- ing the spirit of global unity,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIn our quest for a prosperous Pakistan, let us champion the rights and dignity of all humanity, standing as a beacon of hope and justice not only for our own nation but for those across the globe who yearn for freedom,‚Äù he added.

The PML-N chief said at the beginning of the new year, the hearts of people are filled with hope, anticipation, and a shared vi- sion for a Pakistan.

‚ÄúThis year is not just a marker of time but a promise of a journey towards a prosper- ous future, a chance to redefine our destiny collectively.‚Äù

He said in the upcoming February 8 general elections, peoples‚Äô vote holds the power to script a new chapter in our na- tion‚Äôs story. ‚ÄúThis is not merely a political event; it is a call to revolution, a clarion call

to reclaim our destiny through the strength of your voice and the power of your vote.‚Äù

He urged the people to stay strong, united, and resolute in the face of socio- economic challenges.

‚ÄúThe principles espoused by our found- ing father, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah ‚Äî Unity, Faith, Discipline ‚Äî are not just words but guiding beacons for us all. Let them be the pillars on which we build our collective future.‚Äù

99 Your unwavering support and resilience in the face of adversities because of the PTI government have not gone unnoticed. We commend your bravery; we acknowledge

PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif

 

Shehbaz claimed that under the dy- namic leadership of Nawaz Sharif, the PML-N is now not just a political party but a movement, a force capable of great accomplishments.

Together, hand in hand, let‚Äôs move beyond mere survival and aim for prosperity,‚Äù he said.

 

 

 

 

ETPB allocates Rs7m for Kartarpur project & OUR CORRESPONDENT

ISLAMABAD. The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) has started issu-

ing funds for the Project Management Unit (PMU) Kartarpur, a self-revenue generating body that man- ages the Kartarpur Corridor Project.

The Kartarpur Corridor Project is a visa-free border crossing and religious corridor, connecting the Gurudwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan to Gurudwara Dera Baba Nanak in India.

Source told The Express Tribune that after the approval of the federal gov- ernment, the ETPB has ini- tially provided funds worth Rs7 million. Starting from January 2024, the board will provide the PMU Kartarpur a monthly pay- ment of Rsi3 million.

The ETPB will provide an amount of Rs312 million in grants to PMU Kartarpur during a two-year period to stabilize its financial position.

During the 353rd meeting of the ETPB in October 2023, the PMU Kartarpur chief executive officer had informed the board‚Äôs chair- man and members about the unit‚Äôs severe financial losses.

Later, the board members had unanimously ap- proved the provision of Rs13 million monthly to the PMU for a period of two years. After receiving approval from the federal government, the accounts section of the ETPB has initiated the provision of funds to the PMU Kartarpur.

The caretaker federal government on Friday decreased the prices of petroleum products by up to Rs14 per litre for the next fortnight on the recommendation of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority. According to a notification issued by the Finance Division, petrol, which was earlier being sold at Rs281.34 per litre, will now be avail- able at Rs267.34 per litre, showing a drop of Rs14. Petrol is an alternative to the compressed natural gas (CNG), especially in Punjab where CNG outlets rely on imported gas. However, in the recent winter, LNG was not made available to them.

Similarly, the price of high speed diesel witnessed a de- crease of Rs13.50 per litre to Rs276.21 per litre from the previous Rs289.71 per litre.

Diesel is widely used in transport and agriculture

sectors. The reduction in its price will bring the inflationary impact down and relief for farmers.

Further, the price of kerosene oil also witnessed a decline of Rsio.14 per litre to Rs191.02 from the earlier Rs201.16. Kerosene oil is an important household fuel because of its use for cooking and heating purposes in remote areas.

The government on Thursday slashed the price of high speed diesel (HSD) by Rs7 per litre in line with fluctuation in the global oil prices effective from Dec 1, 2023. Following the reduction, high speed diesel (HSD) will be sold at Rs289.71 per litre against the earlier price of Rs296.71 per litre, registering a decline of Rs7 per litre. However, the government decided to maintain the existing prices of petrol for the next fortnight during month of December. Petrol will be sold at its existing price of Rs281.34 per litre. The government has decided to reduce the price of kerosene oil by Rs3.82 per litre. Following the reduction, kerosene oil will be available at Rs201.16 per litre against its earlier price of Rs204.98 per litre. The price of light diesel oil (LDO) has also come down by Rs 4.52 per litre from Rs180.45 to Rs175.93 per litre.

Meanwhile, Ogra has raised the consumer price of LPG by 1.5 per cent.

Following the federal government's policy guidelines, the regulator has set new prices for LPG effective from Dec 1, 2023.

The LPG price is now available at Rs213,560.49 per ton, which equates to Rs2,520.01 for an 11.8kg cylinder. This is an increase from Nov 2023, when the prices were Rs209,731.22 per ton and Rs2,474.83 per cylinder.

The LPG consumer price has also been adjusted. For Dec 2023, it is set at Rs254,860.49 per ton or Rs3,007.35 for each 11.8kg cylinder. In Nov 2023, the consumer price was Rs251,031.22 per ton or Rs2,962.17 per cylinder. This marks an increase of Rs3,829.27 per ton and Rs 45.18 per cylinder.

Ogra attributed the price changes to the fluctuation in the US dollar exchange rate, which went up by 1.87%.

However, the Saudi Aramco Contract Price (CP), which also influences LPG prices in Pakistan, remained unchanged. As a result of these factors, the LPG consumer price saw an increase of 1.5%, or Rs45.18 per 11.8 kg cylinder, and the per kilo increase in LPG consumer price is Rs3.82.",342.0,281.34,289.71,Govt slashes diesel price by Rs7,0.1,0.6,0.2,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.1,0.45,0.3,0.15,0.3,0.65,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.3,0.4,0.25,0.02,1.25,0.07,0.6499999999999999,-0.5

Ever since the start of October, petrol and diesel prices have gone down by Rs4o, and the rupee has made more than Rs 20 in gains against the dollar in the same time period.

However, commodity prices and transport fares, since the start of October, have remained steady and are yet to see a decline - a trend that is expected to continue into November.

""Retailers and transporters are quick to increase prices to save their profits but never want to help out the inflation-battered populace when fuel prices decrease,"" remarked Mohammad Shaheer of the Gulbahar area in Peshawar.

""Rice still costs about Rs350 per kilogram, and beef costs anywhere between Rs800 to Rs850 per kilogram. So, the decrease in the dollar or fuel rate has not benefited us at all,"" he added.

Nevertheless, the predicament is not exclusive to Peshawar; Lahoris feel the same way about the recent decline in fuel prices and a better-performing rupee.

""Transporters are quick to raise fares when fuel prices go up but do not extend us the courtesy of reducing fares when fuel prices go down,"" said Amjad, a resident of Lahore, who further added that this behavior was a classic example of profiteering.

Muhammad Ejaz, a government employee residing in the provincial capital of Punjab, agrees. ""Even when the government gives relief to the masses by slashing fuel prices, we are left to the mercy of retailers and transporters, who only seem to care about their businesses,"" said an irate Ejaz.

The situation is not any different in the country's most populated city. Shahnaz Akhtar, a housewife, who is a long-term resident of the port city, bemoaned the inflation rate despite recent decreases in fuel prices and improvement in the dollar rate. ""My medicines still cost the same amount that they used to two months back. We have literally no benefit from the improvement in economic indicators,"" complained Akhtar, ""I wonder if we will ever reap the benefits of this supposed economic recovery."" Irshad Sohail, a 55-year-old working professional based in the metropolis, concurring with Akhtar's assessment, deplored the government's lack of attention towards profiteers. Sohail, who has a cardiovascular disease, informed The Express Tribune that the prices of his medicines surged up by 25 to 30 per cent when both the dollar and fuel crossed the Rs300 mark ""but they have not come down despite the recent decline in both the dollar and fuel rate"".

""This goes to show that the government has refused to take any serious action against profiteering and hoarding,"" concluded Akhtar.

Anum Naeem, an economist based out of Lahore, understands the conclusion that Akhtar draws. ""We have seen that the government is quick to claim credit whenever there is a reduction in petrol and diesel prices and the dollar rate improves, but its responsibility does not stop there. The government should ensure that these benefits are passed on to the people in terms of reduced commodity prices and a lower cost of commute,"" suggested Naeem.

If the government restricts itself to announcing a decrease in fuel prices every fortnight, then it is doing precious little for economic recovery, as per Dr Mumtaz Anwar, an economist and a professor at the University of Punjab, who agrees with Naeem. ""It is the government's responsibility to extend the benefits of a reduction in fuel prices and decline in rupee-dollar parity from traders to the general public. If it does not do so, then economic activity will continue to decline, and the economy will suffer in the long run.""

However, Malik Naeem, a trader at the Rampura Gate area in Peshawar, believes that even if the government were to start enforcing price limits, it would not be practical for traders like him to comply. ""I purchased my stock when both fuel and the dollar rate were above the Rs300 mark. Why should I sell it for cheap now? When I buy new stock at reduced rates, I will be happy to pass it on to my customers,"" declared Naeem.

A similarly defiant Malik Qaiser Gujjar, owner of a local transport company in Southern Punjab, claimed that the reduction of pettol prices could not be seen in a vacuum. ""When fuel prices were at an all-time high, many transporters were forced out of business. Now we have fewer buses to meet the demand, thus we have to charge more,"" explained Gujjar while talking to The Express Tribune.",787.0,283.38,303.18,"Stubborn inflation: fuel and rupee improve, prices don't",0.0,0.1,0.3,0.4,0.2,0.02,0.05,0.15,0.55,0.23,0.0,0.05,0.15,0.55,0.25,0.0,0.02,0.1,0.4,0.48,-1.0,-1.3399999999999999,-0.7000000000000001,-0.9199999999999999

The price of petrol has been reduced from Rs 323.38 to Rs 283.38 per litre, effective from today, Oct 16. This reduction is in line with fluctuations in the global oil prices and the strengthening of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar.

Petrol is predominantly used in motorbikes and cars as an alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG), especially in the Punjab province where indigenous gas is not available at CNG retail outlets.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is used in CNG retail outlets in Punjab, but for the past couple of years, LNG has been unavailable due to the failure of the Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) to import it.

The private sector has struggled to import LNG since 2015, but gas utilities have thwarted these efforts, seemingly to maintain their monopoly.

The government has also reduced the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs15 per litre, bringing it down from Rs318.18 to Rs303.18 per litre. HSD is primarily used in the agriculture and transport sectors, and this price reduction may help alleviate inflation to some extent.

The price of kerosene oil, whose consumption increases significantly during winters in remote areas, has been reduced to Rs214.85 per litre, marking a Rs22.43 reduction.

Kerosene oil is commonly used in stoves, particularly in remote areas, including the northern regions of the country. Pakistan Army is also a major consumer of kerosene oil.

The government has increased the petroleum levy by Rs 5 per litre on HSD, raising it from Rs50 to Rs55 per litre. A petroleum levy of Rs 60 per litre is charged on petrol.

However, the government imposes zero sales tax on these two petroleum products. Sales tax revenue goes to the provinces, while petroleum levy revenue is collected by the federal government. This explains why the federal government reduced the sales tax to zero but continued to increase the petroleum levy. In addition, the government imposes a petroleum levy of Rs50 per litre on the HOBC and Rs32.56 per litre on E-10 gasoline. E-10 gasoline is a biofuel composed of 90% regular unleaded and 10% ethanol, a natural byproduct of plant fermentation. The government collects approximately Rs75 billion in revenue from petroleum levy from oil consumers every month, according to some estimates. Sources indicate that the prices of petroleum products on Platts, a price benchmark service for the oil industry, have significantly decreased, and the Pakistani rupee has strengthened against the US dollar. Over the past two weeks, the Pakistani rupee has gained an average of Rs 7.50 against the US dollar. The average prices of petrol and HSD on Platts, including incidentals and duties, are Rs233.49 per litre and Rs305.93 per litre, respectively.

In the caretaker government's first step of providing relief to the inflation-hit people, the prices of petroleum products have been reduced by up to Rs 11 per litre, in a first major decline in two months on the back of a strengthened rupee.

The new prices have been implemented from Sunday (today).

The price of petrol has been reduced by Rs8 -- from Rs331.38 per litre to Rs323.38.

Similarly, the rate of high-speed diesel (HSD) has been decreased by Rs11 - from Rs329.18 per litre to Rs318.18.

The new prices will remain in effect for the next 15 days.

The finance ministry said the prices of petroleum products had been reduced because of the decrease in the international oil rates.

The international oil prices settled 1% lower on Friday due to macroeconomic concerns and profit taking, but rose about 30% in the quarter as OPEC+ production cuts squeezed global crude supply.

Front-month Brent November futures settled down seven cents to $95.31 per barrel at the contract's expiry, up about 2.2% in the week and 27% in the third quarter. The more liquid Brent December contract was settled down go cents to $92.20 per barrel.

US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) settled down 92 cents to $90.97, up 1% in the week and 29% in the quarter.

With oil futures inching closer to $100 a barrel, many investors took profits on the rally given ongoing macroeconomic concerns.

The finance ministry also cited the improvement in the value of the Pakistani rupee as one of the factors behind the reduction in the prices of petroleum products.

The Pakistani rupee has claimed the title of the world's best-performing  currency for September, marking a seven-week high against the US dollar. On the 17th successive working day of its upward trajectory, the rupee closed at an impressive Rs287.74 against the greenback, gaining 0.35% or Rs 1.01, according to the State Bank of Pakistan's data.

Over the past 17 working days, the Pakistani currency has cumulatively strengthened by an impressive 6.73%, recovering 19.36 from its record low of Rs307.10/$ on September 5, 2023. This remarkable performance has brought the rupee back to its pre-caretaker government levels. Earlier, the authorities were expecting the price of a litre of petrol to fall by Rs11.98 and the rate of HSD to dip by Rs9.17 but it turned out to be the other way around. However, the consumers of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are in for tougher times ahead as the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has notified an increase of Rs21 per kg of the product for the month of October. According to a notification issued by Ogra, the price of a domestic cylinder of LPG has been jacked up by Rs246. From Sunday, a domestic cylinder of LPG will cost Rs3,080 instead of its earlier price of Rs2,833. Similarly, the price of commercial LPG cylinder has been increased by Rs947. Ogra has set the price of LPG for commercial use at Rs261 per kg against its previous rate of Rs240. The price a commercial LPG cylinder has been pushed up from Rs10,902 to Rs11,849.",528.0,323.38,318.18,Rising rupee helps govt rein in runaway POL prices,0.1,0.6,0.25,0.03,0.02,0.15,0.4,0.2,0.15,0.1,0.15,0.65,0.15,0.03,0.02,0.25,0.2,0.3,0.15,0.1,0.8800000000000001,0.35000000000000003,0.73,0.35000000000000003

In another massive hike in the rates of petroleum products on Friday after the interim set-up took over the reins in August, the price of petrol was increased by Rs26.02 per litre while that of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs17.34 per litre.

On Thursday, speculations were rife that the prices of petrol and HSD could go up by Rs14 and Rs16 per litre, respectively for the next fortnight, while the kerosene oil price would also get costlier by about Rs 10 per litre. However, the increase was far more than expected.

A finance ministry statement said, ""Owing to the increasing trend of petroleum prices in the international market, the government has decided to revise the existing consumer prices.""

After the hike, the price of petrol reached a historic high of Rs331.38 per litre while HSD is available at Rs329.18 per litre. The new prices were effective from midnight.

The caretaker government had on Sept 1 authorised price hikes for both petrol and diesel, propelling petrol prices to surpass the historic Rs300 per litre threshold for the first time in the country's history.

This new increase will further burden the citizens who are already grappling with ongoing economic challenges, including soaring inflation, rupee depreciation against the dollar, inflated utility bills, and escalating prices of essential commodities. The prices of kerosene oil and light diesel oil (LDO) were not announced. Diesel is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors, and therefore, any increase in its price causes a massive inflationary impact. Kerosene oil is used for cooking purposes in remote areas, especially in the northern parts of the country where the LPG is not available for cooking. Pakistan Army is also its key user in these areas. Meanwhile, the bench mark international Brent prices went beyond $92 per barrel on Wednesday against $88 in the first week of September.

On Thursday, sources said that the government was all set to pass on to the consumers about 88 paisas per litre impact of increase in sale margins for petroleum dealers and marketing companies already approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet last week.

The import parity price for petrol, diesel, and kerosene oil had increased by about Rs13, Rs14 and Rs10 per litre, respectively since Sept 1, but sale prices were estimated to go up by Rs13, Rs16 and over Rs10 per litre  as per product imports by  the Pakistan State Oil. Jet fuels are also estimated to  be costlier by Rs10 per litre. Similarly, the sources said, the petrol and diesel prices were estimated to cross Rs320 and Rs325 per litre, respectively. The kerosene oil rate would be on the higher side of Rs240 per litre. The increase in the prices of petroleum products came on the heels of over 27.4 per cent increase in the August rate of inflation that would also have a lag effect on general prices in the country over the coming days and weeks.",504.0,331.38,329.18,"Petrol, diesel witness massive price hikes",0.0,0.05,0.1,0.5,0.35,0.0,0.01,0.1,0.6,0.29,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.4,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.08,0.32,0.6,-1.4,-1.52,-1.15,-1.17

In utter disregard to a growing public discontent over a surging cost of living and inflated power bills, the caretaker government on Tuesday gave in to the International Monetary Fund (IME) diktat and announced a whopping Rs 18.44 per liter increase in the price of petroleum products.

As citizens already grapple with shrinking purchasing power, protests have erupted across cities, with people burning electricity bills and obstructing roads. The decision to raise petrol prices by Rs 14.91 per liter and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs18.44 per liter threatens to fuel further unrest, as multiple protests are slated in the days ahead.

The shocker came on a day Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) shares plummeted by 1,242.14 points due to rumors of impending interest rate hikes, economic instability, and the relentless depreciation of the rupee. The currency hit an unprecedented low of Rs305.55 against the US dollar, depreciating by Rs1.50.

Meanwhile, the per tola price of 24 karat gold surged by Rs 3,400 to reach Rs 239,800, nearly reaching its peak of Rs 240,000 set earlier this year. This surge followed interim Finance Minister Shamshad Akhtar's statement that fiscal constraints prevented the government from providing subsidies.

Among the factors driving these price hikes in petroleum products is the significant depreciation of the rupee against the dollar.

According to a notification issued by the Finance Division, the price of petrol increased by Rs 14.91 to Rs 305.36 per litre from the earlier Rs290.45 while that of diesel rose by Rs18.44 to Rs 311.84 as compared with Rs293.40 per litre.

The price of both petrol and diesel crossed the Rs300 per litre mark for first time in history. Diesel is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors. Therefore, a massive increase in its price would have a negative impact on the lives of the masses.

Due to its use in transportation, the transport cost will go up that would result in higher inflationary impact on commodities.

The farmers also use diesel in tractors and therefore, the rise in its prices will also increase their miseries. Pakistan's a net importer of petroleum products and any depreciation in the value of the rupee against the dollar had also resulted in the hike in prices of both petrol and diesel that are widely used by the masses. The prices of kerosene oil and light diesel oil were supposed to be hiked by Rs13.82 per litre and Rs8.66 per litre, respectively. But the government has not been announcing the prices of these petroleum products for the last couple of months. Therefore, according to the notification issued by the Finance Division, there was no announcement regarding the new rates of these two petroleum products. The finance ministry in a statement said that owing to the increasing trends of petroleum prices in the international market and ex- change rate variation, the government decided to revise the existing consumer prices of petroleum products. It said that new prices of petroleum products would be effective from Sept 1, 2023. The government was charging heavy taxes on petroleum products. It was charging petroleum levy on petroleum products up to Rs55 per litre from the oil consumers. It collected Rs75 billion on account of petroleum levy on petroleum products from the consumers in the month of July. It was also expecting another Rs75 billion petroleum levy from the consumers during the month of August. With rise in prices of petroleum products and shortage of dollars in the country, the smuggling of the petroleum products from Iran had witnessed a sharp rise. The legal oil industry in Pakistan had raised the issue of smuggling with the government several times. The Petroleum Division had also taken up the matter with the interior minis- try and the Federal Board of Revenue to take measures to stop smuggling of petroleum products from Iran. But it still continued that resulted in decline in sale of petroleum products by the local industry. This means that petroleum dealers have been selling Iranian oil at a price higher than the one notified by the government, oil industry officials said. According to report, there were 1,500 petrol pumps that were black-listed by the local oil companies but they were storing smuggled Iranian petrol and diesel and also selling to the masses at higher rates.",727.0,305.36,311.84,POL price hike adds to people's misery,0.0,0.01,0.05,0.7,0.24,0.0,0.01,0.05,0.45,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.25,0.72,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.35,0.6,-1.69,-1.5499999999999998,-1.17,-1.42

In a stunning display of legislative acrobatics in July, the joint sitting of parliament redrew the lines of political authority as it bestowed upon the upcoming caretaker set-up with an unprecedented mandate to navigate major economic and political landscapes.

Parliament increased the powers of the caretaker setup by amending Section 230 of the Elections Act of 2017, among other things.

""Provided that sub-sections (1) and (2) shall not apply where the caretaker government has to take actions or decisions regarding existing bilateral or multilateral agreements or the projects already initiated under the Public Private Partnership Authority Act, 2017 (VIII of 2017), the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act, 2022 (XXX of 2022) and the Privatisation Commission Ordinance, 2000 (LII of 2000),"" the substituted clause of Section 230 read. However, instead of explicitly defining the term 'existing', parliament has opened the gateway for the caretaker set-up to wield significant economic authority during its fleeting three-month tenure, which was earlier supposed to bridge the gap before an elected government assumes power after the general elections.

The caretaker set-up has raised the price of petrol by Rs17.50 per litre for the last fortnight of August (16 to 31).

""The petroleum prices in the international market have increased during the last fortnight and as a result, the consumer prices in Pakistan are also being revised,"" a statement issued by the finance ministry said.

Following the upward revision of Rs17.50 per litre, the price of petrol has increased to Rs290.45 per litre from the previous Rs272.95per litre.

Similarly, with the fresh jump of Rs2o per litre, the price of high speed diesel (HSD) has reached Rs293.40 per litre from the earlier Rs273.40 per litre.

In the last revision of its tenure, the PDM government had also increased the prices of petrol and HSD by Rs1g.95 per litre and Rs19.90 per litre, respectively for the first fortnight of August.

The HSD is mainly used in transport and agriculture sectors. Therefore, increase in its price will have a direct inflationary impact on the life of a common man.

Incase of petrol, it is used in motorbikes and cars. It is also considered to be an alternate to CNG.

However, CNG retail outlets, especially in Punjab, had been operating on imported gas as the indigenous gas was not available for the last over a decade.

As the prices in Pakistan continue going up due to depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, the smuggling of oil from Iran had increased that had hit the legal oil industry in Pakistan hard. The local oil industry had been voicing concerns regarding smuggled oil from Iran that led to a drop in sale of legal oil industry but no action had been taken so far. Due to shortage of the dollar, the previous PDM government had also ignored the smuggling of petroleum products as it was meeting the domestic demand.

The main reasons for the increase in the oil prices was also due to hike in the international oil market and depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar.

sita the For the next fortnight, the government has not changed petroleum levy on petrol and it will remain at the existing level of Rs55 per litre, however, for the HSD, it has been reduced by Rs5 per litre to Rs 50 per litre. The The dat GST will remain zero on both the products.

Earlier, the government used to share increase/ decrease in the prices of HSD, petrol, kerosene oil and light diesel oil, however, since the last few fortnights, it is merely sharing the prices of petrol and HSD.

With a few days left in office, the government on Tuesday jacked up the prices of petroleum products by a staggering Rs19.95 per litre with immediate effect (August 1).

The term of the incumbent regime is scheduled to end on Aug 12.

In his televised remarks, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar maintained that the decision was made ""in the national interest"" as he announced that the cost of High Speed Diesel (HSD) was being increased by Rs19.90 to Rs273.40 per litre while that for petrol was hiked by Rs 19.95 to Rs272.95 per litre.

He said the new rates were effective immediately.

Earlier, petrol was being sold at Rs253 per litre whereas diesel at Rs253.50 per litre.

Dar explained that the hike was due to the increase in the prices in the international market over the last 15 days.

He also stressed that his team had tried to ""work"" on the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority's (Ogra) recommendations until the wee hours of the night but found themselves with their backs against the wall.

""The basic reason behind the delay in the announcement was that we were looking for ways to reduce the price, but there was no room for that,"" he said, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also been taken into confidence and that the approval came albeit with reluctance.

Petrol is used in motorbikes and cars whereas diesel is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors.

The government is currently charging the highest-ever rate of petroleum levy from the consumers.

It was charging Rs 62 per litre petroleum levy on direct sale of petrol, Rs52.15

per litre on HOBC, Rs 0.05 per litre on kerosene oil, Rs 57 per litre on HSD and Rs33.37 per litre on E-10 gasoline.

However, it was charging zero petroleum levy on light diesel oil (LDO).

So, the government was charging highest rates of petroleum levy on two key products - petrol and diesel. The regulator had also slashed the rate of inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) that was negative of Rs1.36 per litre on HSD.

It allowed Rs 2.63 per litre FEM on petrol, Rs5.68 per litre on kerosene oil, Rs4.73 per litre on LDO and Rs 0.54 per litre IFEM on E-10 gasoline.

The price of kerosene oil stands at Rs 192.38 per litre.

The Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had asked for taking weighted average premium on imports at $10.43 per barrel to determine the price of petrol to which the government agreed.

The PSO had also asked for making adjustments of Rs2.60 per litre to include in price computation on account of Sindh Infrastructure Cess. However, the demand was turned down by the regulator.

Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb noted that the incumbent government had ""responsibly managed"" the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and taken decisions to raise petroleum products prices ignoring the ""political cost"".

On the contrary, the previous regime violated the agreement with the IMF just for political gains, she said while addressing a news conference after inauguration of the Foreign Media Digital Wall of Digital Electronic Media Unit at the Directorate of Electronic Media and Publications in the federal capital.

""The government's tenure will end in a few days, but we have prioritised the state over politics. In contrast, (PTI chief) Imran Khan, who was certain about the end of his government, subsidised petroleum products and violated the IMF agreement which inflicted massive damage on the economy,"" she maintained.

The government on Saturday slashed the prices of key petroleum products for July 16-31 fortnight on the back of strengthening of the rupee against the US dollar following approval of a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced a Rs 9 per litre reduction in the price of petrol and Rs7 per litre in price of high speed diesel. The new prices would take effect on July 16 (today) and continue until July 31.

The rupee has appreciated by Rs 8.42 against the dollar climbing to Rs278.58 from Rs286.99 in the wake of the approval of IMF's Stand-By Arrangement and fresh deposits from Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the state Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

Announcing the new fortnightly fuel prices on the state television on Saturday night, Dar said that the prime minister had issued directives for reducing the prices of petroleum products.

Accordingly, the petrol price has been reduced by Rs 9 per litre to Rs253. Its price during the last fortnight was Rs262 per litre. Similarly, the price of high speed diesel declines by Rs7 to Rs253.50 per litre from Rs260.50 per litre.

The minister said that the international fuel market had been fluctuating during the outgoing fortnight - July 1-15. However, the government also withheld the decision of increasing petroleum development levy (PDL) for second half of July.

""There was an increase in one product and decline in the others,"" the finance minister said. ""But the strengthening of the rupee against the dollar has offset the price increase,"" he added

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar shared the news in a tweet late last night, stating that the newly announced rates would be valid until July 15.

Dar has said that the price of oil has increased significantly in the world market due to which the price of diesel is being increased by seven and a half rupees per litre.

However, the finance minister did not clarify whether there were any changes in kerosene and light-diesel oil prices.

He said that OGRA had recommended keeping the prices to a minimum, which was decided after consultation with the prime minister.

Earlier, Ogra had sent the summary of the prices of petroleum products for the next fortnight to the finance ministry. It was anticipated that the government would give relief to the people.

On June 15, the government had announced that the prices of petroleum products would remain unchanged for the next 15 days.

However, Pakistan's oil consumers were expected to get a relief of Rs6. 48 per litre in the price of petrol for the first fortnight of July.

It was also anticipated that the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) may surge by Rs13.84 per litre, which would have widely impacted its consumers as HSD is primarily used in transport and agriculture sectors.

Any upward revision in the price of diesel sparks inflationary pressures owing to the increase in freight rates for goods transportation and rise in the cost of planting crops.

On the other hand, the expected reduction in the price of petrol, which is considered an alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG), was expected to provide some relief to the motorists and bikers.

With the failure of Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) to clinch import contracts, the provision of LNG to the CNG retail outlets, especially in Punjab, has encountered obstacles. Therefore, car owners are mainly dependent on petrol.

Industry sources had indicated that the proposed changes in petrol and diesel prices are based on current rates of petroleum levy and general sales tax (GST). The petroleum levy has been fixed at Rs 50 per litre for both petrol and HSD.

Earlier this week, oil fell, giving up earlier gains, as worries over further interest rate hikes and slowing demand offset support from an industry report showing a larger-than-expected drop in US crude inventories.

Benchmark Brent crude prices are down over 15% this year as rising interest rates hit investor appetite, while China's economic recovery has faltered after several months of softer-than-expected consumption and other data. At 1348 GMT, Brent was down 43 cents, or 0.6%, to $71.83 a barrel, while US WTI crude slipped 12 cents, or 0.2%, to $67.58. ""For now, the market remains stuck with demand concerns weighing,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. ""OPEC production cuts have helped prevent a deeper setback.""

The government on Thursday kept petroleum product prices unchanged for the second fortnight of June. However, the price of light diesel oil (LDO) was increased by Rs 2.52 to Rs 150.20 per litre, Prices of petrol, high-speed diesel (HSD) and kerosene oil were left unchanged for June 16 to 30, 2023. Earlier, it was projected that the price of petrol would be reduced by Rs 1.87 per litre while HSD would become expensive by Rs3.29 per litre.

These two are the most consumed petroleum products, Petrol is used in motorbikes and cars whereas HSD is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors.

Addressing a press conference, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said that during the last two rounds, the prices of petroleum products were significantly reduced. The price of HSD was slashed by Rs35 per litre whereas petrol saw a reduction of Rs 20 per litre, he said.

The minister pointed out that the prices of petroleum products slightly increased in the international market from June 1 to 15, therefore, the government decided to keep them unchanged.

The decision to keep the HSD price unchanged will provide some relief to the consumers who are reeling from a soaring inflation. For the upcoming fortnight, prices of petrol and HSD will stand at Rs262 per litre and Rs 253 per litre respectively. Besides petroleum levy, the prices of these products also include the inland freight equalisation margin (FEM) and margins of dealers and oil marketing companies (OMCs). The oil industry is charging IFEM of Rs 4.04 per litre on petrol and Rs3.79 per litre on HSD. Consumers also pay Rs 50 per litre in petroleum levy on petrol and HSD. OMCs' margins have been fixed at RS 6 per litre for petrol and Rs 5 per litre for HSD while dealers' commission currently stands at Rs7 per litre for the two products.

The government also maintained the price of kerosene oil at Rs164.07 per litre. Earlier, it was anticipated that kerosene oil would become expensive by Rs2.10.

According to a finance ministry statement, the price of petrol was slashed by Rs12 per litre, diesel by Rs30 per litre, and kerosene oil by Rs12 per litre. The price cut takes effect from Tuesday for the next fortnight.

Keeping in view the declining trend in the international market, the government had decided to reduce the existing prices of petroleum products to provide maximum relief to the people, the statement said.

According to the government announcement, the price of petrol comes down from Rs282 to Rs270 per litre. The high speed diesel (HSD)

will now be available at Rs258 per litre against the previous rate of Rs288 per litre.

Petrol is used in motorbikes and cars. This is also an alternative fuel of compressed natural gas (CNG). The HSD is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors. Therefore, its reduction will have a healthy impact on agriculture, as the sowing season continued.

The price of kerosene oil has also come down from Rs176.07 to Rs164.07 with a reduction of Rs12 per litre, while the light diesel oil (LDO) will be sold at Rs 152.68 per litre against earlier price of Rs164.68 per litre.

Kerosene oil is used in remote areas, especially northern parts of Pakistan, for cooking purposes where liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is not available. The Pakistan army is also a key user of kerosene oil in northern parts. The LDO is used in industry.

Finance Minister Dar hoped that the prices of other commodities would also come down with the reduction in the prices in petroleum products. He urged the transporters to reduce their fares for the benefit of the already burdened masses.

The government is currently charging maximum petroleum levy (PL) of Rs50 per litre on petrol, high speed diesel and high octane blending component (HOBC). This is the maximum rate the government had approved in the budget.

Therefore, the government did not have the space to adjust reduction in prices of petroleum products to generate more revenue. The revenue on account of petroleum levy goes to the federal government.

Similarly, LDO will be sold at Rs164.68 per litre against the old price of Rs174.68 per litre.

Also the government reduced the price of kerosene oil by Rs 10 per litre. Now, the kerosene oil will be available at a price of Rs176.07 per litre compared with the old price of Rs186.07 per litre.

The HSD is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors. At present, the Kharif crop season is under way, therefore, a decrease in the price will have a healthy impact on farmers, who are already facing higher oil prices.

The government is currently charging a maximum rate of petroleum levy (PL) of up to Rs 50 per litre on high octane blending component (HOBC), petrol, and HSD to boost the its revenues.

Therefore, the government passed on relief to the consumers on the HSD. Although, the government was expected to reduce the price of petrol but no change was announced, keeping the existing price of Rs282 per litre.

The petrol is used by motorbikes and cars. This is also an alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG).

Earlier, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced a hike in the petrol and kerosene oil prices in a press conference. Dar said the fuel prices have been increased for 15 days after which they will once again be revised in accordance with the international prices.

The prices of High Speed Diesel (HSD) and the Light Diesel Oil (LDO) will, however, remain unchanged. The HSD and the LDO are respectively available at Rs293 and Rs174.68 per litre.

The light diesel oil (LDO) is used in industry.

The average daily consumption of petrol stood at 20,000 metric tons (MT) per day and the HSD 15,500 MT per day during 1-15 April. The oil industry said the consumption of the HSD had dropped to half despite the harvesting season due to senior executive of an oil smuggling of Iranian oil to Pakistan.

The sale of local oil marketing companies has constantly been on the decline for the last  few months mainly due to the dollar crisis and the government policy to discourage the import of crude oil and petroleum fuel. To fill this gap, oil smuggling from Iran has gone up.

It is estimated that around Rs8,000 to 10,000 tonnes of the HSD is being smuggled into Pakistan on a daily basis. However, Iranian petrol is not in as much demand due to its lower quality and an overall reduction in the petrol demand.

The local industry has expressed serious concerns over smuggling of fuel and reduction in diesel sales.

The price of high speed diesel (HSD) was also raised by Rs17.20 per litre.

The petrol price was shot up by Rs35 per litre at the end of last month, primarily due to massive devaluation of rupee against dollar.

The fresh hike in the prices of petrol and diesel is also due to rupee depreciation against dollar, the finance ministry said in a statement.

According to the finance ministry, the government had also increased the price of kerosene oil by Rs12.90 per litre and light diesel oil (LDO) Rs 9.68 per litre.

After the surge, the price of petrol has gone up to Rs272 per litre against its earlier price of Rs249.80 per litre, registering a hike of Rs22.60 per litre.

Petrol is an alternative to compressed natural gas (CNG).

Due to shortage of gas in the country, CNG is not available in the market.

Meanwhile, Punjab had been using liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the last few years in CNG stations due to shortage of gas.

However, LNG was not available in the country during the current winter season due to non-availability of fuel in the global market and failure of government companies to make timely arrangements.

The closure of CNG stations is stated to be one of the reasons for increase in the demand of petrol.

The price of HSD, which is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors, also shot to Rs280 per litre, compared to its earlier price of Rs262.80 per litre, with an increase of Rs17.20 per litre.

The hike in the price of diesel will result in an increase in the transportation fares, ultimately leading to rise in the prices of goods across the country.

Kerosene oil will now be available at Rs202.73 per litre against its earlier price of Rs189.83 per litre.

It is used for cooking purposes especially in the remote areas of Pakistan where liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is

not available. Pakistan Army is also key consumer of kerosene oil in northern parts of the country.

Light Diesel Oil (LDO), which is mainly used in the industrial sector, will now be sold at Rs196.68 per litre against its earlier price of Rs187 per litre, witnessing a hike of Rs9.68 per litre.

LPG prices Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has jacked up the price of LPG by Rs2 per kg for the last 15 days of February, and issued a notification in this regard. According to the notification, LPG price has been fixed at Rs266 per kg after witnessing a hike of Rs2 per kg while the price of domestic cylinder has increased by Rs27 and commercial cylinder by Rs 102 for the second half of February.

Following the issuance of the OGRA notification effective February 15, LPG will be available at Rs266 per kg while domestic cylinder at Rs3,141.29 and commercial cylinder at Rsi2,086 in the open market.

LPG Association Chairman. Irfan Khokhar termed the price hike ""unbearable"" and advised all district presidents of LPG associations to stage protests. He said that instead of giving relief the government had imposed more taxes while billions of rupees subsidy was being offered in the imported LNG. He noted that this was the second time that the price of LPG had in- creased during February.

He said the government should allow the LPG plant of Jamshoro Joint Venture Limited (JJVL) to start production at the earliest in order to provide relief to the people, noting that the plant had been closed for the last 32 months and caused a revenue loss of around Rs157 billion.",638.0,272.0,280.0,Rising cost of living: fuel prices jacked up again,0.0,0.05,0.1,0.55,0.3,0.0,0.01,0.1,0.55,0.34,0.0,0.0,0.03,0.4,0.57,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.35,0.6,-1.54,-1.5499999999999998,-1.0999999999999999,-1.22

In another unpopular decision, the coalition government jacked up the prices of petrol and high speed diesel (HSD) by a whopping Rs35 per litre, two days ahead of the scheduled announcement of fuel prices in the country.

The fuel price hike comes amid a massive depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. There were already rumours about a big increase in prices of petroleum products. It is learnt that the retail outlets of petroleum products forced the government to announce the new prices on Sunday. Usually, fuel prices are adjusted on a fortnightly basis. Change in the prices or unchanged prices are announced on every 15th and the last day of the month, effective from the 1st and 16th.

However, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced the latest price hike on 29th of January, instead of 31st. 

With the increase of Rs35, according to the announcement, the petrol prices jumped from Rs214.80 to Rs249.80, while the HSD prices rose from Rs227.80 to Rs262.80. 

Similarly, the prices of kerosene oil rose by Rs18, from Rs171.83 to Rs189.83, and light diesel oil from Rs169.00 to Rs187.00.

Earlier, there were rumours about the massive increase in fuel prices in the wake of rupee's free-fall last week. This led to the closure of the retail outlets of petroleum products, hence the government was forced to announce the new prices on Sunday, a couple of days before the scheduled time. The move aimed at resuming the sale of petroleum products ? at retail outlets. This appeared to be a failure of the government to take action against the petrol pump owners who hoarded the fuel stocks and dropped a petrol bomb on the consumers. Currently, the government is charging Rs50 per litre petroleum levy on petrol. It also raised the rate of the levy on the HSD by Rs5 per litre to R$40 per litre on Sunday. Also, it raised prices of petroleum products, on the one hand, and put an additional burden of Rs 7.49 per litre on oil marketing companies (OMCs) on account of freight margin, on the other. The government allowed the Inland Freight Equalization Margin (IFEM) to the OMCS to transport petrol to different oil depots across the country. It went to negative Rs 3.21 per litre during the ongoing month to negative Rs 10.70 per litre. This means that the OMCS will not be receiving any freight rate on transportation of petrol, rather they would be bearing the burden of Rs10.70 per litre on petrol. Dar announced the hike in the prices of all the petroleum products, in a short televised address on Sunday morning. ""The new prices will come into effect within next two to three minutes, by 11am,"" the finance minister said, adding that the new prices would be effective till February 15, 2023. Dar also said that the increase was being made immediately on the recommendation of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), which had reported artificial shortages and hoarding of fuel in anticipation of price rises. ""Hence this price hike is being done. immediately to combat the artificial shortage.""

Dar recalled that during the last four months, from October to January 29, the price of petrol was not increased, while the prices of diesel and kerosene oil were decreased. The rupee depreciated by almost 12% against the dollar last week, while the oil prices increased by 11% in the international market. the ""Despite international prices and the rupee devaluation, on directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, it has been decided to make the minimum increase in the prices of these four products,"" he said. The retails outlets stopped selling the fuel on Saturday after speculation of up to Rs80 per litre increase in the prices of Petrol and HSD.

Kerosene oil is currently priced at Rs171.83 per litre and that will also remain unchanged. Further, light diesel oil (LDO) is presently priced at Rs179 per litre, and that too shall remain unchanged for the next 15 days,"" the finance minister said while addressing media persons on Sunday.

The government was to announce the new fuel prices to be implemented from January 16 to January 31, however, the finance minister said that no changes would be introduced ""in accordance with the advice of Nawaz Sharif"".

Previously, it was expected that the price of petrol would go up by Rs8.98 per litre while the price of HSD may rise by Rs1.06 per litre in the fortnightly revision of petroleum products' prices.

However, sources in the Petroleum Division had said that the government could keep prices unchanged at current levels for January 16 to 31 by adjusting the rate of petroleum levy.

At present, the government is charging consumers Rs 50 per litre petroleum levy on petrol and Rs32.50 per litre on HSD. However, no general sales tax is collected on the sale of petroleum products which include pettol, HSD, high octane blending component, kerosene oil and light diesel oil.

Apart from the petroleum levy, the inland freight equalisation margin had been fixed at Rs3.51 per litre on the sale of petrol and at Rs 0.81 per litre on the sale of HSD. Further, the oil marketing companies' margins of Rs 5 per litre are collected on the sale of petrol and HSD while the commission of dealers has been set at Rs7 per litre for the two petroleum products.",332.0,214.8,227.8,Govt keeps petrol rate unchanged,0.0,0.1,0.7,0.15,0.05,0.0,0.05,0.85,0.05,0.05,0.005,0.02,0.95,0.02,0.005,0.05,0.55,0.35,0.05,0.0,1.734723475976807e-18,0.6,-0.15,-0.10000000000000002

It decided to leave the prices of petrol and high speed diesel (HSD) unchanged at the current levels for the first half of January 2023.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar expressed gratitude to the prime minister for taking the decision.

The current price of HSD is Rs227.80 per litre and petrol Rs214.80 per litre.

The current price of kerosene oil is Rs171.83 per litre and light diesel oil (LDO) Rs169 per litre.

The HSD is widely used in agriculture and transport sectors.

The kerosene oil is used for cooking purpose mainly in areas where LPG is not available for cooking. Pakistan Army is its main user in the northern parts of the country.

These prices will also remain the same up to January 15, 2023.

The minister in his televised addressed to the nation on the state-run electronic media highlighted that the oil prices were on the rise in the international markets, informing about the calculations made by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) in this regard.

The minister said that the Ogra had calculated an increase of Rs8.76 per litre in the price of kerosene oil to Rs180.59 per litre from the existing rate of Rs171.83.

Similarly, for the LDO, Ogra suggested an increase of Rs7.96 to Rs176.73 per litre.

""The prime minister has taken this decision to maintain the oil prices in the wake of extreme cold as people use kerosene oil as fuel for heating and cooking,"" Dar added.

The minister said that the price differential will be adjusted in the petroleum levy (PL) by the government, suggesting that revenue collections at oil products would be less in the first fortnight of January 2023.

On the other hand, the oil products have witnessed a declining trend in the country and it will be witnessed in the month of January too, industry sources said.

""Diesel sale in December 2022 Was 510,000 tonnes, whereas the same was around 610,000 tonnes in December 2021. Similarly, petrol consumption too declined by around 100,000 tonnes to around 630,000 tonnes in December 2022,"" a senior official of the petroleum industry said, adding that this decline had two main reasons - reduction in consumption due to high rates, and increased smuggling from Iran - that too because of price differential.

Currently, the PL at one litre of petrol has reached its upper cap of Rs50, while it was Rs35 for each litre of HSD sold, leaving space for the government to increase the levy and keep the prices unchanged.

Apart from the international oil rates, the serious impact faced by the oil marketing companies (OMC) in Pakistan was the fluctuating exchange rate.

The largest oil importer in the country is the state-owned Pakistan State Oil, and it was facing huge rupee-dollar exchange loss on the imports of petroleum products, and as the petroleum prices were kept unchanged, the OMCs could not recover the amount from the customers, thus creating a huge backlog to be paid by the government.",519.0,214.8,227.8,Govt keeps POL rates unchanged,0.0,0.1,0.7,0.15,0.05,0.05,0.15,0.5,0.2,0.1,0.0,0.12,0.85,0.03,0.0,0.2,0.35,0.2,0.2,0.05,0.09,0.44999999999999996,-0.15,-0.15

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar in a tweet said that the government had reduced the price of high speed diesel by Rs7.50 per litre. The government slashed the price of petrol by Rs10 per litre, kerosene oil by Rs10 per litre and light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs 10 per litre. Following reduction in the prices of petroleum products, the high speed diesel will be sold at Rs227.80 per litre. Petrol will be available at Rs214.80 per litre following reduction in the price. The kerosene oil will be sold at Rs171.83 per litre.

The price of light diesel oil has been reduced to Rs169 per litre.

The finance minister, during a news conference, said that the price of high- speed diesel (HSD) had been slashed by Rs7.5, petrol Rs 20, kerosene oil Rs 10 and LDO by Rs10. He said that the new price of HSD would be Rs227.80 per litre, petrol Rs214.80 per litre, kerosene oil Rs171.83 per litre and LDO Rs169 per litre.

Dar said that the new price would be implemented from midnight. According to the calculation, the price of HSD was to be reduced by Rs12.37 per litre for the second half of December 2022.

The government committed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it would impose general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products once they reached the maximum limit for petroleum levy which was Rs 50 per litre on each petroleum product.

The government is charging a petroleum levy of Rs 50 per litre on petrol, Rs2s per litre on HSD, Rs7.01 per litre on kerosene oil and Rsis.39 per litre on LDO.

The government, however, promised the international lender that it would increase the petroleum levy on HSD to Rs 50 by April 2023.

The government had reduced the price of HSD by Rs7.50 per liter against projected reduction of Rs 12.37 per litre.

The HSD is widely used in agriculture and transport sectors. Therefore, partial reduction in its price was also a major relief for agriculture and transport sectors which would reflect in inflationary impact on the lives of the people. Petrol is used in motorbikes and cars and is an alternative of CNG.

The CNG stations in Punjab have been operating on imported LNG which is not available during the current season. Therefore, the demand of petrol will be higher during the month of December.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday announced that the government was keeping prices of petrol and diesel unchanged effective from December 1, 2022.

The diesel price was supposed to be reduced by Rs11.95 per litre but the government's decision deprived consumers of a major relief.

The diesel price was left unchanged in a bid to raise the petroleum levy rate to collect more revenue from the oil consumers.

Diesel is a key product and is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors. A revision in its price has a direct bearing on the life of the common man. After the latest decision, the diesel price will continue to remain at Rs235.30 per litre.

The government has already increased the petroleum levy on petrol and high octane blending component (HOBC) to the budgeted level of Rs50 per litre.

On the other hand, the price of petrol should have gone up in line with the trend in international markets but the government decided not to revise it on Wednesday.

The finance minister announced a reduction of Rs 10 per litre in the price of kerosene oil and Rs7.50 per litre in the rate of light diesel oil (LDO).

Kerosene oil is used in remote areas for cooking purposes where pipeline gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are not available.

The kerosene oil price has come down from Rs191.83 to Rs181.83 per litre and the LDO price has dropped from Rs186.50 to Rs179 per litre.

The petrol price should have gone up by Rs2.62 to Rs227.42 per litre. However, the government decided to maintain its price at Rs224.80 per litre for the next two weeks.

Petrol is used by motorbikes and cars and is an alternative to the compressed natural gas (CNG).

Oil industry has recently protested against keeping petroleum prices artificially stable by reducing freight charges, margins and adjusting the exchange rate. It claimed that it had faced a loss of over Rs7 billion due to the government's move to keep oil prices low.

The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) said that prices of motor fuels had been left unchanged for the second fortnight of November 2022 despite the fact that the rates should have gone up based on the government's approved pricing formula.

Instead of passing on the increase or absorbing the impact of the increase by reducing the petroleum levy, the price components were unjustly reduced which included freight margins, exchange loss adjustment and denial to pass on increased margins of oil marketing companies (OMCs).

The oil industry body said that the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) was reduced by Rs3.21 and Rs2.72 per litre on motor spirit and high-speed diesel respectively.

It further said that the exchange loss adjustment was reduced by Rs3.01 and Rs2.11 per litre on motor spirit and diesel respectively.",481.0,224.8,235.3,Govt decides against POL price cut,0.0,0.05,0.1,0.7,0.15,0.0,0.05,0.1,0.55,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.45,0.5,0.05,0.02,0.13,0.2,0.4,0.25,-0.6,-0.73,-0.95,-1.0999999999999999

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, who is in the United States to hold important meetings with the global ending institutions, announced in a video statement that rates of oil would be maintained for the next fortnight - October 16 to 31. The finance minister had received a summary in Washington which was moved by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra). Dar said in the video statement that he had consulted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and decided to keep the oil prices unchanged.

According to recommendations, a minor reduction was suggested in the price of petrol whereas a proposal to increase the price of diesel, kerosene oil and light diesel oil (LDO) was on the cards.

Dar said the government would not pass on the recommended minor reduction in the price of petrol to the consumers.

According to the industry officials, a reduction in the price of petrol by around Rs 10 per litre was in the offing. However, an increase was suggested in the price of diesel by Rs11 per litre, kerosene oil by Rs 4.52 per litre and LDO by Rs7.48 per litre.

Meanwhile, the average rate of dollar also declined from Rs235.95 to Rs222.13 and its impact on oil prices had been worked out at Rs13.82 per litre.

The government had decided to maintain the existing price of petrol at Rs224.80 per litre, diesel Rs235.30 per litre, kerosene oil Rsi91.83 per litre and LDO Rs186.50 per litre.

As diesel in widely used in transport and agriculture sectors, fluctuation in its price has a direct impact on the life of consumers.

Petrol, which is used in motorbikes and cars, is an alternate for CNG. Due to the shortage of gas in Pakistan, especially in Punjab, the demand of petrol widely increased.

Kerosene, an alternate for LPG, is used in remote areas and is consumed for cooking purposes. The armed forces are also a main consumer of kerosene oil in northern parts of the country.

Earlier, the government had placed a major cut in the price of petroleum products by up to Rs 12.6 per litre effective from October 1.

The government, reportedly, is using the energy prices as a tool to win support of voters in the by-polls.

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) had also decided to increase the power tariff by Rs3.21 per unit put a burden of Rs 94 billion on consumers. However, on Saturday, it claimed that there would be no increase in the existing rates.

This is stated to be a technical fraud as the past tariff increased on quarterly adjustment was going to end and the government would have to impose new tariff on the consumers on account of fourth quarterly adjustment.

In his maiden press conference, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday announced to cut petroleum products prices by up to Rs12.6 per litre or 5.4% by making adjustments in taxes but still keeping those significantly lower than the International Monetary Fund requirement.

The decision is likely to provide a major relief to the inflation-stricken people who have been exposed to inflationary pressures, because of mismanagement of the exchange rate regime in addition to the global commodity prices impact.

The fresh price reduction is exclusive of any positive impact of the rupee strengthening that is expected to be felt in the next price determination.

The petrol price has been reduced to Rs224.80 per litre from Rs237.43 after a reduction of Rs12.63, said the finance minister. Effectively, the petrol prices, which is the most consumed petroleum item, have been reduced by 5.3%.

The initially proposed reduction was lower than what Ishaq Dar announced, as he created room for deeper cuts by lowering the petroleum levy rate by Rs5 to Rs32.42 per litre. The former finance minister, Miftah Ismail, had increased the petroleum levy rate to Rs37.42 last month when he was in fact required to set it to a maximum of Rs30 per litre. However, under the deal with the IMF, Pakistan was supposed to increase the petroleum levy to Rs 40 per litre on October 1st. Ishaq Dar has, for now, kept the taxes lower than the IMF deal in the hope to secure some concessions during his first visit to Washington this month.

Ishaq Dar told The Express Tribune that he would attend the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF. He is expected to take up the issue of getting concessions from the IMF in the aftermath of the devastating floods.

Ishaq Dar also said that the high-speed diesel price has been reduced by Rs12.13 per litre or 4.9%. It will now be sold at Rs235.30, down from the existing Rs247.43, the minister said. He increased the petroleum levy rate on high speed diesel to Rs 12.58 per litre  - up from Rs7.58.

Still, the rate is significantly lower than the requirement determined by the IMF to collect Rs855 billion in petroleum levy by gradually increasing these taxes to Rs 50 per litre on all petroleum and LPG products.

The new prices will come into effect at midnight tonight, the Finance Minister said.

Similarly, kerosene oil's new price will be Rs191.83 following Rs 10.19 or 5% reduction, said Dar.

Earlier, the kerosene oil was sold at Rs202 per litre. The government has kept the petroleum levy rate on kerosene oil at Rs15 per litre.

Dar said that light diesel oil's price will be Rs186.50 per litre after a decrease of Rs10.78 or 5.4%. The old price was Rs197.28 per litre. The government will charge Rs 10 per litre levy on light diesel oil.

Ishaq Dar said the decision to reduce the prices has been taken after a ""detailed discussion"" with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

The move will provide a major relief to the people who are bearing record fuel and electricity prices. One of the reasons behind the higher prices of these items is the irrational depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar till last week.

During this week, the rupee covered Rs11.20 a dollar or 4.7% of its lost value, without any improvement in the economic fundamentals. There are strong signals that commercial banks have heavily manipulated the dollar price for their vested interests. These banks made an undue profit of Rs27.7 billion during the April-June quarter of this year on account of foreign exchange earnings.

The State Bank of Pakistan has given show cause notices to these banks but is still shy of imposing heavy penalties, including a possibility to get the concerned officials of these banks sacked for manipulation of the currency that caused a national crisis-like situation.

The global crude oil prices are also on a downward trajectory and were traded at around $87 per barrel on Friday. Ishaq Dar is also expected to review the petroleum prices determination formula, which is currently tilted in favour of the oil marketing companies.",697.0,224.8,235.3,POL prices slashed by Rs 12.6 per litre,0.1,0.6,0.2,0.05,0.05,0.15,0.6,0.15,0.08,0.02,0.2,0.6,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.28,0.32,0.15,0.18,0.07,1.0,0.56,0.6499999999999999,0.78

As the country reels through floods, the government on Wednesday dropped another petrol bomb, increasing the prices of petroleum products from September 1, despite the Oil and Gas Regulatory  Authority's (Ogra) proposal for a reduction.

The government has hiked the price of petrol by Rs2.07 per litre, high-speed  diesel Rs2.99 per litre, kerosene oil Rs 10.92 per litre and light diesel oil by Rs9.79 per litre.

Following the fresh increase in prices, petrol has gone up from Rs233.91 to  Rs235.98 per litre; high-speed diesel from Rs244.44 to Rs247.43 per litre; kerosene oil from Rs199.40 to Rs210.32 per litre and light diesel oil from Rs 191.75 to Rs 201.54 per litre. The finance ministry said in a statement that the government had considered the recommendations to make the partial increase in petroleum prices in line with the changes in international prices along with the fluctuation in the exchange rate.

The ministry also said that the petroleum levy had been kept minimum in order to provide relief to the consumers.

High-speed diesel is widely used in the agriculture and transport sectors, Since the country is already witnessing rising inflation and floods, the prices of commodities are likely to surge. The increase in high-speed diesel, therefore, directly hits the people and increases the inflationary impact.

Petrol is used in personal means of transport, While Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is an alternative fuel, all CNG stations have been selling Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) instead. Pakistan has not arranged LNG imports, therefore, there is a shortage at CNG stations as well. This leaves the public without any alternative fuel source.

Kerosene oil is widely used in remote areas of Pakistan, including places up north, where Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is not available for cooking. The Pakistan Army also uses kerosene oil in remote areas of the country. The massive increase in its price will add to the inflationary pressure on the poor who used it for cooking. """,334.0,235.98,247.43,Another petrol bomb dropped amid floods,0.0,0.05,0.1,0.5,0.35,0.0,0.01,0.1,0.45,0.44,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.35,0.6,0.0,0.01,0.09,0.35,0.55,-1.5499999999999998,-1.4400000000000002,-1.15,-1.32

In recent days, the position of the rupee had strengthened against the dollar. Despite that, there had been an increase in the price of petrol. And, there had not been any major cut in the price of diesel which is widely used in agriculture and transport sectors in the country.

Price impact As the HSD is mainly used in agriculture and transport sectors, reduction in its prices will have a direct inflationary impact on the life of the masses. The farmers are already facing high prices of electricity and the reduction in price of HSD might cause some relief in the cost of doing business. The price of HSD is already at a high level. The fresh nominal reduction in its price may not have a major impact on the transport and agriculture sectors that are directly linked to activities of farmers and the people. Due to hike in the price of diesel, transport fares have already gone up, resulting in higher prices of commodities in the country. Petrol is used in motor bikes and cars. Its alternative is compressed natural gas (CNG). The CNG retail outlets in Punjab have been operating on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the cost of it has gone up manifold due to Russia- Ukraine conflict. Even, Pakistan has been unable to secure LNG contracts on spot basis due to the highest-ever prices of commodities in the international market. Pakistan LNG Limited - a state run company - had failed to arrange the LNG cargoes even during the last winter season. Australia had been a major gas exporter. However, as its regulator put curbs on gas exports, further shortage of gas in the global market is expected. In this situation, Pakistan may not be able to secure contracts for the upcoming winter season. Therefore, the next winter will also be tough for the commuters. In this situation, the consumers in Punjab will be relying more on petrol and fresh increase in its price will have a negative impact on the life of those using motorcycles and cars in the province, experts added.

The government on Sunday reduced the price of petrol by Rs3.05 per litre and that of light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs 0.12 per litre from August 1 (today) but increased the price of high speed diesel (HSD) by Rs8.95 per litre and that of kerosene oil by Rs 4.62 per litre.

The decision followed up on Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif's announcement on July 14 in which he announced a cut in the price of diesel by Rs 40.54 per litre in the wake of a major reduction in global oil prices from July 15. Shehbaz also announced a reduction of Rs18.50 per litre in the price of petrol.

At that time, Premier Shehbaz had promised to continue passing on the impact of reduction in the global oil prices to the consumers in Pakistan.

With the latest announcement, the price of petrol has been reduced from Rs230.24 to Rs227.19 per litre; LDO goes down from Rs191.44 to Rs 191.32 while the HSD goes up to Rs244.95 from Rs236 and kerosene oil Rs196.45 to Rs201.

The finance ministry said in a statement that government had decided to revise the existing oil prices following fluctuation in global oil prices and exchange rate variation. It added that new prices of petroleum products will be effective from August 1, 2022 (today).

Price impact

The HSD is mainly used in agriculture and transport sectors. Therefore, any increase in its prices will have direct inflationary impact on the life of the masses. The farmers are already facing high prices of electricity and the HSD might cause further hike in the cost of doing business, experts said.

They added that the additional increase in price of diesel will add miseries of the people and farmers in agriculture sectors. Due to hike in price of diesel, the transport fare might also go up, resulting in higher prices of commodities in the country.

The petrol is used in motorbikes and cars, Its alternate is compressed natural gas (CNG). The CNG retail outlets in Punjab have been operating on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the cost of it have gone up manifold due to Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Pakistan had been struggling to strike LNG contracts on spot basis. However, the state-run LNG firm, the Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) had been unable due to higher prices offered by traders and reluctance of traders to participate in bids of Pakistan, the experts have said.

""Therefore, the consumers in Punjab will be relying more on petrol,"" an expert said. ""The reduction in its price will also have healthy impact on the life of those using motorcycles and cars in the province,"" he added.

Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Thursday announced a reduction of Rs 40.54 per litre in the price of diesel and Rs 18.50 per litre in that of petrol in order to pass on the benefit of the drop in global oil prices to the consumers.

Addressing the nation on television and radio, the prime minister said that by slashing the petroleum prices, the incumbent government was also fulfilling its promise of passing on the benefit of any decrease to the consumers in Pakistan.

He pledged to continue passing on the impact of reduction in global oil prices to the people in the coming months, ""There has been a major reduction in global oil prices and therefore the government had decided to pass on the relief to the Pakistani consumers,"" he said,

According to a notification, the government, besides reducing the prices of petrol and high speed diesel, also slashed the price of kerosene oil by Rs 33.81 per litre and the light diesel oil by Rs34.71 per litre from midnight Thursday.

Accordingly, the per litre price of petrol comes down from Rs248.74 to Rs230.24, high speed diesel from Rs276.54 to RS236, kerosene oil from Rs230.26 to Rs196.45 and light diesel oil from Rs226.15 to Rs191.44.

Holding the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government responsible for all the economic woes, Shehbaz expressed determination of the coalition government to put the country on the path to economic development and prosperity during the next 14 months.

""The previous government signed an agreement with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) on tough conditions and laid down landmines for us by suddenly reducing the oil prices, which the treasury could not bear,"" he said.

""When we took over [in April], our economy was destroyed, Oil prices were touching the roof, We had no other option but to increase the petroleum prices, knowing its impact on common man. If we had any other option, we would have never opted for difficult decisions,"" he said,

The prime minister also criticised the previous government of poor performance during its more than three-year tenure, ""The Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower project is an example of poor performance of the past governments,"" he said,

The project was supposed to be completed in four to five years but it took 20 years, the prime minister said, adding that the project cost was around $4-5 billion, whereas its original cost was $1 billion.

Similarly, he added, the Haveli Behadur Shah project was another example, which was not completed in time. ""We should learn lessons from the bad experiences of the past that wasted huge funds of the country's economy,"" the prime minister said.

""In the coming months, the government will focus on three vital areas of economy - agriculture, IT (information technology) and the export-based industries,"" the prime minister told the nation.

""The nation will see a big change in the agriculture sector in the next 14 months, I have formed a task force to prepare a plan to boost the agriculture sector,"" he said, adding that the government would announce a policy to bring a revolution in the agriculture sector. ""We will improve the agriculture sector with better decisions and policy making.""

Shehbaz said that IT was another sector that had the potential for the youth to earn money, He pledged to revolutionise the sector by equipping the youth with IT skills that would boost IT exports. 

""We will bring substantial increase in IT exports in one year,"" he said, adding that export-based industry was another sector the government was focusing on.

The prime minister said that government had inked an agreement with the IMF. Acknowledging Finance Minister Miftah Ismail and his team's efforts in concluding the agreement, he expressed commitment to make the country economically independent.

""There are nations which had agreements with the IME, some even 25-30 years ago but then they changed their directions, worked hard and today those countries have become prosperous,"" he said.

""We're hoping that this is our last agreement with the IMF. Self-sufficiency is the only way, It is the only honourable way to live. But it is not easy to achieve. The path it is leading to is filled with thorns,"" he added.

""I have faith that Pakistan will see that time, If we follow what the Holy Quran has ordained us with, I have no doubt that difficulties will vanish,"" the prime minister said, appealing to the nation to work hard to achieve the goal.

The new prices will be effective from Friday (today). Earlier, the government had been charging zero petroleum levy and general sales tax on petroleum products to absorb the impact of the hike in global oil prices and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. The government increased the price of petrol by Rs14.85 per litre, from Rs233.89 to Rs 248.74 per litre. High speed diesel (HSD) has been upped by Rs13.23 per litre, from Rs 263.31 to Rs276.54. Kerosene oil has been jacked up the most, Rs18.83 per litre to Rs230.26 from Rs211.43 per litre. This was followed by low diesel oil (LDO), with its price being increased by Rs 18.68 per litre to Rs226.15 from Rs207.47.

The government has imposed Rs10 per litre petroleum levy on petrol, Rs5 per litre on HSD, Rs5 per litre to on kerosene oil and RS5 per litre on LDO. Addressing a news conference, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said that the increase was made to meet the conditions set forth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

""Imran Khan [government] had violated the agreement with the IMF to increase the petroleum levy every month,"" the minister told media persons.

He said that the agreement with the global lender was moving forward smoothly and as per plan.

The minister said that the increase was made in view of the rising prices of petroleum products in the international market.

He said that the tenure of agreement with the IMF had been increased from three to four years.

The size of the loan programme had also been increased from $6 billion to $7 billion, he added.

""Sales and income tax refunds of all sectors have been made.""

On the occasion, Minister of State for Petroleum Musaddiq Malik hoped that the country would stabilise financially in a few months to come.

""The government is aiming at providing relief to the masses. We are working to rid the country of inflation and generate jobs.""

Malik added that the focus of the government was on boosting small businesses and creating more opportunities for the youth.

This month, the government had already increased the price of HSD by Rs59.16 per litre, petrol by Rs24.03 per litre, kerosene oil by Rs33.12 per litre and LDO by Rs 25.53 per litre.

The present government is already facing criticism due to its massive hike in oil prices after it came to power.

The coalition government had made an increase in diesel price by up to Rs 59 per litre effective from the start of the current month.

This increase was the fourth shock that had hit the consumers.

Following the increase in oil prices, the government had given Rs2,000 per person subsidy to eight million people and planned to bring six million more poor into the safety net to provide relief.

Earlier, the government had claimed that it was paying Rs 100 billion monthly bill to clear price differential claims for keeping the oil prices lower.

The government had said that it would have to pay an annual bill of Rs1.20 trillion for subsidy if it decided not to increase the oil prices.

The incumbent government claimed that the previous PTI regime had not increased the prices of gas since December 2021, It had resulted in Rs1.4 trillion circular debt in the gas sector.

HSD is mainly used in transport and agricultural sectors. Therefore, more increase in its price would bring a flood of inflation across the country.

It will affect the farming sector that is already facing a miserable situation due to a record increase in the prices of fertiliser. Therefore, it will impact the prices of food products across the country.

Petrol is used in motorbikes and cars and therefore, further increase in its price will also hit the middle-class society.

The new prices would come into effect from midnight tonight, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said while addressing a news conference in Islamabad. He was flanked by State Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik.

The finance minister blamed the previous PTI government for making a faulty agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that had tied the hands of the incumbent and forced it to increase oil prices to put the economy on right track.

He said that the government had a big challenge to rescue country. ""If we don't increase oil prices, the country could face a default.""

He added that it was a difficult decision though to increase the prices of petroleum products, However, he added that government would protect the poor.

After the increase, petrol will be available at Rs 233.89 per litre after a hike of Rs 24.03, HSD at Rs263.31 per litre following a rise of Rs 59.16 per litre, kerosene oil at Rs 211.47 pet litre after a surge of Rs 29.49 and light diesel oil at Rs207.47 pet litre after an increase of Rs29.16.

The government has raised the price of petrol by more than Rs 84 per litre in the last 20 days.

The minister said the international price of petrol was $120 per litre as he tried to justify the hike.

""The government had no choice but to pass on the impact of international prices to consumers in Pakistan,"" he added.

He also blamed PTI chairman and former premier Imran Khan's policies that had ""caused the current situation"".

""I have been seeing the country's situation for 30 years, but I've never seen such a situation in terms of inflation.""

Ismail claimed that the government was tied by pacts made by the PTI government with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

He admitted that the middle class would suffer from the petrol price hike.

However, he added that the government would take steps to limit the impact on the most vulnerable.

""We have taken difficult decisions before and we will take in the future as well to protect the country from financial difficulties.""

The minister said the government would not bear a loss in the sale of petrol anymore as the fresh hike had brought the fuel price at par with its international rates.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Petroleum Musadiq Malik maintained that the government had considered in detail before announcing the latest increase.

""This decision is taken because we import nine million tonnes of oil every year, and 8.8m tonnes of diesel and if we did not increase the price, the government would have had to bear a loss of over Rs 100 billion monthly.""

The state minister added that the government accepted the responsibility for its measures and would determine a new way forward for the country through difficult decisions.

To a query, Miftah said Pakistan could not control the Ukraine-Russia war and its impact on international fuel prices.

""We will only be able to control fuel prices when our difficult period ends and the country's relations with global financial institutions improve.""

Earlier this month, the federal government had decided to raise the prices of all petroleum products with the exception of one by another Rs30, just a week after making a similar increase.

Back then, Miftah had said the government was still facing a loss of around Rs 9 in petrol despite a hike of Rs30 as it was ""not collecting any tax"" on the fuel.

The minister had added that the government was holding talks with the IMF every day.

The federal government has decided to raise the prices of all petroleum products with the exception of one by another Rs30, just a week after making a similar increase - hours after the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) approved a massive increase of Rs7.91 per unit in the power tariff.

The new fuel prices will come into effect from midnight - petrol will be available at Rs209.86 per litre, high-speed diesel (HSD) at Rs204.15, kerosene oil at Rs181.94 and light diesel oil at Rs178.31.

Only the price of kerosene oil was increased by less than Rs30.

With the new hike in the power tariff, the price of a unit is expected to move upwards from Rs16.91 to Rs24.82.

Despite an inevitable increase in the prices that will unleash a strong wave of inflation, the coalition government remains short of clinching a deal with the International Monetary Fund that still requires an agreement on the budget for fiscal year 2022-23.

But Finance Minister Miftah Ismail did not give a surety to withdraw gas and electricity subsidies accorded to the richest people and fuel allowances of cabinet members, judges, generals and bureaucrats.

Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said the government was still facing a loss of around Rs 9 in petrol despite a hike of Rs30 as it was ""not collecting any tax"" on the fuel.

The minister added that the government was holding talks with the IMF every day. ""We cannot accept all their demands but there are certain points that we have to agree to.""

He maintained that the subsidy on petroleum products announced by ex-premier Imran Khan had to be withdrawn to avert financial losses.

""Irrespective of what the IMF says, the government cannot sell petrol and diesel by bearing losses.""

However, Miftah said the government would ensure stability in prices of sugar and wheat at Rs70 per kg and Rs40 per kg respectively at utility stores across the country.

The minister added that the government was willing to import oil from Russia, provided it did not come with sanctions.

Nepra has increased the electricity rates mainly on account of fuel prices, capacity cost payments and the impact of rupee devaluation against the US dollar.

  The base tariff has gone up to Rs24.82/kWh -- higher by Rs.7.9078/kWh than the earlier determined national average tariff of Rs16.91/kWh -- determined by the power regulator for the ongoing financial year.

This is the highest average tariff rate for the power consumers.

After the PML-N-led coalition government came into power, the electricity sector has spiralled out of control because of prolonged outages.

The recent increase in fuel and electricity rates will add to the miseries of the people, who are already feeling the heat of runaway inflation.

Experts say that increase in fuel prices and tariff rate would also bring about another flood of inflation in Pakistan as it would increase the cost of doing business in the country.

Due to higher fuel and energy costs, the prices of all products in Pakistan will further rise.

Nepra has sent the hike to the federal government for issuance of a notification. The new tariffs will be applicable after the final notification from the government, according to a statement.

""The tariff once notified is then charged to the consumers,"" it added.

However at the new conference, Miftah said the government had not decided to increase the power tariff as yet.

As per the Nepra statement, the Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO), Sukkur Electric Power Company (SEPCO), Quetta Electric Supply Company (QESCO), Peshawar Electric Power Company (PESCO) and Tribal Electric Supply Company (TESCO) had filed multi-year tariff petitions for the FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25.

Also, the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO) and Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO) had filed annual adjustment or indexation request under the already allowed multi-year tariff.

The power regulator has projected the total profit from the hike at Rs1.15 trillion. It has also projected capacity charges including National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) and high voltage direct current (HVDC) cost at Rs1.36 trillion.

The total revenue requirement of XWDISCOs including DISCOs margin and prior year adjustment is projected at Rs2.8o trillion with projected sales of 113,001 GWh.

Nepra further said that MEPCO, GEPCO, HESCO, SEPCO, QESCO, PESCO & TESCO had been allowed an investment of around Rs 406 billion for their distribution investment programme for the five-year period.

However, the power regulator had reduced XWDISCOs allowed T&D losses from 13.46% to 11.70% for the FY 2022-23.",826.0,209.86,204.15,"Double whammy for consumers as fuel, power prices jacked up",0.0,0.05,0.1,0.6,0.25,0.0,0.05,0.1,0.45,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.35,0.6,0.0,0.02,0.18,0.35,0.45,-1.5499999999999998,-1.23,-1.05,-1.2

Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Sunday said the government was not increasing the prices of petroleum products ""for the time being""  - a decision that was against one of the key pre-conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the revival of the country's loan programme - and might reconsider its move soon.

Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, Miftah said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, despite his advice against the move, was unwilling to overburden the people by jacking up the fuel prices.

He added that PM Shehbaz firmly believed that increasing petroleum prices was not an option considering the difficult position the people of Pakistan already found themselves in.

The minister added that a summary for this purpose had been sent to the premier for a swift decision.

""I will talk to the IMF to find a middle ground. [The talks] will conclude positively.""

However, the minister clarified that fuel prices could be ""adjusted anytime in the future"" in line with the increasing international oil prices.

""I am not saying we will never increase the prices. The point is we are not increasing them today, but we can adjust them at any time in the future.""

After his news conference, the minister reiterated his message on Twitter.

""Let me amplify what I just said in my presser,"" he wrote. ""The government will not raise POL prices today. But due to changing circumstances and international oil prices, we may have to revisit our decision soon.""

During the news conference, the minister, while referring to PTI Chairman Imran Khan's criticism of the current government over the plummeting value of the local currency, took a dig at the former premier calling him the ""king of rupee devaluation"".

The minister also said that while the PTI chief boasted of having increased the country's foreign reserves, there was no evidence to support his claims. ""Where have you put the money you speak of?""

He blamed the PTI government for being unable to curb the smuggling of wheat and petroleum, and ""wrecking"" the economic stability of the country.

Ismail claimed that the previous regime had promised the IMF in December last year that the primary deficit would be Rs 25 billion and the total deficit would be around Rs 4 trillion. ""The primary deficit has increased from Rs 25 billion to Rs1.32 trillion,"" he added, questioning how could the new government bring it down in a few months.

The minister also alleged that the IMF had ended its programme with the PTI-led government and the latter wanted to keep the development under wraps.

The minister said friendly countries including Saudi Arabia had assured economic cooperation and talks were under way for the extension of the deposited period.

He added that the Saudis had promised to extend the term of deposits from December this year. ""They have also agreed to negotiate an increase in deposits.""

Informing about the wheat production which is 26 million tonnes as per the official record, he said on the instructions of the prime minister, the government was keeping its reserves.

The minister further maintained that according to the current situation, imports were expected to touch $75 billion.

However, Miftah added that the current account deficit would increase significantly as the exports in return were expected to reach $30 billion despite the $30 billion remittances recorded in this financial year.

He noted that at present the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) foreign reserves stood at $10.4. billion, which had fallen to this level because of the mismanagement of the previous administration.

The minister added that the tax-to-GDP ratio in the previous government had also dropped to 8.5%.

The verbal duel between PML-N and PTI leaders over the deteriorating economy continued as Miftah dismissed Asad Umar's comments as ""lies"",

""I wish he wouldn't lie despite his company"", he added.

Earlier in the day, the minister, while responding to PTI leader Umar's tweet, accused the previous government of taking ""80% of all debt"" in the country's history.

The decision to freeze petroleum product prices is going to add another Rs 40 billion to price differential claims (PDC) - the cost of subsidy provided for oil consumers.

The government has decided to keep oil prices unchanged for May 1 to 15, providing some relief to the consumers already reeling from double-digit inflation.

Earlier, oil prices had been kept unchanged for April 16 - 30, which also added Rs 40 billion to the PDC.

The total subsidy for keeping petroleum prices unchanged came in at Rs31.3 billion for March and Rs76 billion for April.

However, the impact of the subsidy has been estimated at Rs 40 billion for the entire month of May if the government decides to leave oil prices unchanged for the second fortnight as well, officials said.

According to sources, the government has released Rs71.3 billion so far for payment to oil companies to clear the PDC. Another Rs28 billion has been approved but funds have not yet been released.

Officials say the total impact of subsidy since March 2022 has been estimated at Rs200 billion, which is a heavy cost of freezing oil prices despite pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut subsidies.

At present, the PDC on diesel and petrol stands at Rs72.33 per litre and Rs30.31 per litre respectively.

If the government abolishes the PDC on diesel and petrol, their prices will go up to Rs216.48 per litre and Rs180.17 per litre respectively.

However, the IMF has sought a reduction in subsidies under its ongoing loan programme. The government has also given assurance to the lender that it will increase prices of petroleum products to fulfill its commitment.

Despite the assurance, the government has not increased prices of petroleum products effective May 1, apparently due to the upcoming Eid and the fear of political backlash.

The previous government also froze oil prices, though the international crude market had skyrocketed. Still, the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel are at record levels in the country.

The government has recently approved a supplementary grant of Rs64 billion to keep oil prices unchanged.

Hoarders and black marketers have started hoarding diesel in anticipation of an imminent hike in prices and the fuel has disappeared from. different parts of the country.

The country has passed through different phases of oil crisis but no permanent solution has been worked out so far.

The government has also kept oil prices unchanged to discourage the hoarders that have created artificial shortage of diesel.

Diesel is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors. Any increase in its prices has had a direct impact on consumers and also fuels inflation.

Currently, the crop sowing season is going on, which has led to an increase in the consumption of diesel. The unchanged prices will provide relief to the farmers.

However, the PDC poses a threat to the oil industry, which could result in the piling up of circular debt if the government delays payments.

The government has committed to clear PDC after every 15 days.

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Friday raised the power tariff by Rs 4.8 per unit on account of fuel adjustment for the month of February 2022. However, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif turned down an increase of up to Rs 51 per litre in the price of diesel proposed by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), effective from April 16, 2022.

The Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G) had requested the power regulator to allow an increase of Rs 4.9441 per unit, which would put an extra burden of Rs38.4 billion on the consumers. The power regulator conducted a public hearing on March 31, 2022.

However, the regulator approved an increase of Rs 4.8530 per unit, putting an additional burden of around Rs37.7 billion on the power consumers.

The power distribution companies will charge fuel cost adjustment of February 2022 in the billing month of April 2022 from all consumer categories of XWDISCOs, except lifeline consumers. This fuel cost adjustment (FCA) would remain applicable only for one month, This FCA is not applicable on K-Electric consumers.

On the other hand, Ogra had proposed an increase in the price of diesel by Rs51.32 per litre (35.7%), petrol Rs21.30 per litre (14.2%), kerosene oil Rs 36.03 per litre (28.7%) and light diesel oil (LDO) Rs38.89 per litre (39.9%).

However, the premier turned down the proposed increase in the oil prices that would put an additional burden of around Rs30 billion on the government exchequer.

The government would have to pay this amount to oil firms on account of price differential claims (PDCs). An amount of Rs30 billion was already due on account of PDCs for keeping oil prices unchanged from April 1, 2022.

The government will be paying a price of Rs60 billion to oil companies for maintaining the existing prices for the month of April.

""The government has maintained the existing price of diesel at Rs 144.15 per litre, petrol Rs149.86 per litre, kerosene oil Rs125.56 per litre and LDO Rs118.31 per litre.

Further, Nepra had observed that the CPPA-G purchased 33.822 GWH energy from Tavanir Iran in February 2022 at a cost of Rs 530.628 million.

However, a contract between CPPA-G and Tavanir Iran for the import of power up to 104MW expired on December 31, 2021.

In view of this, the power regulator allowed the cost of electricity purchased from Tavanir Iran strictly on a provisional basis, subject to its adjustment once the authority decided on the extension in the contract between the CPPA-G and the Tavanir Iran or otherwise.

As per the data submitted by the CPPA-G, the XWDISCOs purchased 10.148 GWh from captive power plants (CPPs) during February 2022, for which the CPPA-G provided actual details of energy purchased from these plants.

According to details provided by the CPPA-G, the actual fuel cost of this energy was Rs51.960 million. The regulator had considered it as per Nepra-approved mechanism, while working out the FCA of February 2022.

During the hearing, the authority also observed that energy from costlier RFO-based power plants was generated to the tune of over Rs 11,301 million with the fuel charges adjustment for the month of February 2022.

The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) reported provisional T&T losses of 241.142 GWh based on energy delivered on its system during February 2022. In addition, the NTDC also reported T&T losses of 22.899 GWh for PMLTC (HVDC) line, It is allowed T&T losses of 2.80% only at 500KV and 220 KV network, while PMLTC (HVDC) is allowed T&T losses of maximum up to 4.3%.

The authority has been directing NPCC/NTDC & CPPA-G repeatedly to provide complete justification in this regard, to its satisfaction and submit complete details for deviation from Economic Merit Order (EMO), showing hourly generation along with the financial impact for deviation from EMO if any, and the reasons, thereof.

During the hearing, NFCC/ NTDC explained that due to the non-availability of RLNG as per the requirements, they generated electricity through RFO/HSD-based power plants.

Upon directions of the authority, NPCC/NTDC also provided justifications, showing hourly generation along with the reasons for the operation of HSD/RFO.

The power regulator decided not to deduct any amount in the instant monthly FCA on account of deviation from EMO.

In view of the discussion, the authority has calculated the fuel cost for the month of February 2022, after accounting for the adjustments, and including costs arising due to the application of various factors, as provided in the respective PPAs of the power producers and claimed by CPPA-G in its FCA request.

Here it is pertinent to mention that regulator also allowed the amount arising out due to the application of PPA factors, for the six RFO based IPPs, incorporated under the 2002 Power Policy, on a provisional basis and shall be subject to adjustment, based on the final outcome of the ongoing suo motu proceedings against RFO based IPPs.

Member Sindh Rafiq Sheikh wrote a dissenting note on the decision of Nepra to raise power tariff.

He said that consumers had to bear a burden of Rs1.37 million due to short supply of the LNG.

He said that the burden of mismanagement in LNG supply should not be passed on to the consumers, adding that timely LNG could be met with better planning.

The Sindh member added that the operation of the less efficient power plant on furnace oil rather than operating efficient plants on RLNG had an adverse effect on the cost of fuel.

Meanwhile, former prime minister Imran Khan had announced a reduction of Rs 10 per litre in the petroleum prices and that the new rates would remain in place till the FY23 budget.

However, this decision of keeping oil prices unchanged had no legal cover as the previous government had not approved it.

If the incumbent government decided to keep the oil prices unchanged from April 15 to 30 then it had to give another Rs30 billion subsidy.

Officials said that the impact of rupee depreciation against the dollar had also resulted in an increase in oil prices by Rs 5.54 per liter or 3.03%.

The average rate of dollar had jumped from Rs182.15 to Rs188.15.

The circular debt situation in oil and gas sectors had already been worsening and accumulation of subsidy or price differential claims would lead to an increase in circular debt in the coming days.

The Petroleum Division had moved a summary to the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (ECC) on April 1, 2022 that additional Rsss5 billion may be allocated through supplementary grant for the disbursement of PDC to OMCs/ refineries for the month of April 2022. The matter has not yet been considered by the ECC.

The international energy markets remained volatile and the premiums on MS and HSD were high. The liquidity of OMCs/refineries was, therefore, under stress. Subsidised prices of petroleum. products added to this stress because the full cost recovery was made only when the PDC claims were processed after a lag of almost a month.

If the energy markets remained in their present situation, the estimated amount of PDCs for the period between April 16 to June 30, 2022 would be Rs136 billion.

The demand for MS and HSD in the country remained very high. This high demand not only made the petroleum market vulnerable to supply disruptions and placed a very heavy burden on the liquidity in the sector, but was also increasing the import bill to a very high level.",1302.0,149.86,144.15,"Power tariff jacked up, POL prices stay put",0.0,0.1,0.3,0.4,0.2,0.0,0.1,0.25,0.45,0.2,0.0,0.03,0.95,0.01,0.01,0.08,0.12,0.3,0.35,0.15,0.0,-0.3699999999999999,-0.7000000000000001,-0.7500000000000001

Prime Minister Imran Khan announced on Monday Rs 10 per litre reduction in the prices of petrol and diesel as well as Rs 5 per unit cut in the electricity tariff, along with a bonanza of incentives in several areas of the economy. In a televised address to the nation, the prime minister, while acknowledging the hue and cry made by the opposition parties about the runaway inflation, among other things, said that there would be no increase in the petrol, diesel and electricity charges until the next budget. Imran's announcements are seen as clear deviation from the International Monetary Fund's (IME) bailout package, wherein the government has already agreed to increase tax rates on the petroleum products. The government has consistently increased power tariff since it entered the IMF programme.

Imran's address to the nation came at a time when the opposition parties have mounted pressure on his government by threatening to send it packing with the no-confidence motion amid speculations that several members of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were ready to jump ship. Though the government would not admit, political pundits believed that the popular measures had been taken to neutralise the opposition parties' no-confidence move. In his address, Imran also announced tax exemptions, subsidies, amnesty for industrial sector, stipends, internships and scholarships, while simultaneously making it clear that his government believed in making ""independent foreign policy"".

Surprisingly, Imran did not spend much time on the opposition's flurry of activities and its plan for a no-confidence motion. Admitting high inflation, he only asked the opposition to present a solution, if they had any, instead of just criticising the government and making it a ground for its ouster.

In his speech, he also defended the newly-promulgated amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), 2016, saying the criticism was unwarranted because the amendments were not aimed at curbing media freedom.

Ina roughly half-an-hour address, the prime minister, with the help of charts and graphs, also listed his government's achievements and compared its performance with the previous ones. He took credit for achieving a 5.6% growth rate, $31 billion remittances; highest exports and tax collections.

Prime Minister Imran announced incentives for information technology (IT) sector by giving 100% tax exemption to both companies and freelancers; 100% foreign exchange exemption and 100% exemption from capital gains tax for investments in start-ups.

Also, the prime minister announced Rs 407 billion subsidised loans to be provided in next two years under the Kamyab Pakistan Programme, saying that the loans would be given to youth, farmers and for low-cost housing.

Announcing an amnesty scheme for the industrial sector, Imran said that no question would be asked for industrial investment and efforts would be made for the revival of sick units through tax benefits. Besides, he declared five-year tax holiday to attract overseas investment in joint ventures.

Under the government's flagship Ehsaas programme, Imran increased stipend from Rsi2,000 to Rs14,000 per month, announced a graduate internship stipend of Rs30,000 per month and allocated Rs2.6 million scholarships with Rs38 billion.

Additionally, he said that Rs 1 million free medical cover to all citizens by end of March, 2022, except Sindh, adding that the health insurance under the Qaumi Sehat Card would help private medical hospitals to boost services in the rural areas.

The prime minister emphasised on making foreign policy independent, keeping the country's interest supreme and not to take dictation from others, He defended the PECA Ordinance, saying that the amendments were brought because social media was filled with filth such as child pornography. He said the content being shared on social media was causing a threat to the institution of family. He regretted that even he was not being spared, recalling that a few years ago a journalist had reported that his wife had left him and that he had done something illegal at his Bani Gala residence. Lamenting that he filed a case but hasn't got relief in three years, he said the same journalist had now written that his wife has left the house. ""If this can happen with the country's prime minister ... imagine what would happen to the rest of the people,"" he wondered. Shocking as it may seem, Imran revealed that the same journalist was locked up and beaten for three days when he wrote about former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's corruption during the PML-N government. The prime minister charged that there were journalists who were spreading filth in exchange for money, adding that the good journalists had no issue with PECA and would want fake news to be eliminated.

Imran recalled that three leading newspapers had carried stories, stating that the selection of AJK's PM was based on some magic and movement of stars. He said one can't even think about saying such things under a democracy in any other country.

Following the speech, social media was abuzz with different interpretation of the address but the two most common takeaways were that Imran was apparently readying himself and the party for the elections and, maybe, the government was thinking to say goodbye to the IMF programme.

Some others questioned how would the government pay for all the measures that the prime minister had announced.

The price of petrol broke all previous records by reaching the Rs160 per litre mark.

However, the finance ministry in a statement said that the prices of petroleum products in the international market are showing a drastic increase and presently, they are at the highest level since 2014.

It said that despite the unabated increase in the prices since the beginning of the year, Prime Minister Imran Khan deferred the last review of rise in petroleum products' prices on January 31, 2022 and advised against the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority's summary.

In order to provide utmost relief to the consumers, the government levied zero percent sales tax and reduced petroleum levy against the budgeted targets.

Resultantly, the finance ministry said that the government was bearing the revenue loss of around Rs35 billion on fortnightly basis due to the petroleum levy and sales tax moves.

In the fortnightly review of petroleum products' prices, the prime minister has considered the recommendation of increasing the prices of petroleum products in line with change in the international oil prices, Despite the increase in the prices of petroleum products, petroleum levy and sales tax have been kept minimum.

Petrol will now be available at Rs 159.86 against Rs 147.83 per litre.

Petrol is an alternate of compressed natural gas (CNG) and used in cars and motorbikes. In Punjab, there is no indigenous gas in CNG retail outlets.

They use imported liquefied natural gas and therefore, the fresh increase will add to the miseries of the middle-class people who use petrol in motorbikes and small cars.

The government has also made a massive increase in the price of high speed diesel (HSD).

This fuel is used in transport and agriculture sectors, Therefore, increase in the price of HSD will have a direct inflationary impact on the masses who are already reeling under high inflation,

The government increased the price of HSD by Rs9.53 per litre, Its price has gone up from Rs 144.62 per litre to Rs 154.15.

The price of kerosene oil has also been increased by Rs 10.08 per litre.

This fuel is used in remote areas of Pakistan like the northern parts of the country where liquefied petroleum gas is not available for cooking.

Pakistan Army also uses it in the northern parts.

It will now be sold at Rs126.56 against Rs116.48 per litre.

There is also an increase of Rs9.43 per litre in the price of light diesel oil (LDO). It will be available at Rs123.97 per litre against Rs114.54.

There has been a continuous increase in prices of petroleum products in recent months.

To ""save the people of Pakistan from inflation"", Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday rejected a summary proposing hike in prices of petroleum products for a fortnight.

Earlier, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) had asked the federal government to increase petrol price by Rs 11 and diesel by Rs 14 for the first 15 days of February.

Ina tweet, the SAPM said that while ""oil prices were rising due to increasing inflation all over the world"", the government wanted to protect the people from inflation.

""Therefore, the prime minister has deferred this summary,"" he added.

It is worth mentioning here that the government's decision to not increase fuel prices comes at a time when it is under severe criticism for not being able to control inflation.

Inflation in the face of unemployment and low income has curtailed the economic power of many citizens, and any measures that increase the burden on the masses are likely to be met with agitation and mistrust.

""The existing sales tax rate and petroleum levy on various petroleum products are much below the budgeted targets,"" it added.

""Against the recommendation of Ogra [Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority] for an increase of Rs5.52 per litre in petrol and Rs6.19 per litre in HSD [high-speed diesel] prices, the prime minister has directed to absorb the international prices through a further cut in sales tax from last fortnight.""

""Therefore, the government has decided to make [a] partial increase in the prices of the petroleum products in order to provide relief to the end consumers. The new prices of petroleum products will come into effect from January 16, 2022.""

The government has hiked price of petrol by Rs3.01 per litre from Rs 144.82 to Rs 147.83 per litre.

Petrol is used in cars and motorcycles, It is also an alternate to CNG.

During the winter season, the CNG stations in Sindh and Balochistan have been shut down. Therefore, the demand for petrol is likely to increase.

The government has also increased the price of HSD by Rs3 per litre from Rs 141.62 to Rs 144.62 per litre,

This fuel is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors, Therefore, the increase in its price will impact the lives of the people because of a possible increase in inflation.

The price of kerosene oil has also witnessed an increase of Rs3 per litre, taking its rate from Rs113.48 to Rs 116.48 per litre.

Kerosene oil is used in remote areas for cooking purpose where LPG is unavailable.

The major user of this fuel is also the army in the remote areas of Pakistan like the country's northern parts.

The price of light diesel oil has also gone up by Rs3.33 per litre from Rs111.21 to Rs 114.54 per litre, This fuel is used in industries.

Petroleum prices are a major component of the country's inflationary calculations.

At the start of the current year, Prime Minister Imran Khan had given the nod to an increase in oil prices by up to Rs 4 per litre.

According to a notification issued by the Finance Division back then, the price of petrol and HSD would rise by Rs 4 per litre for the first 15 days of January 2022.

After the increase, the price of petrol went up from the previous Rs140.82 per litre to Rs144.82 per litre. The price of HSD jumped to Rs141.62 per litre from the previous Rsi37.62 per litre.

But the Finance Ministry in a statement said that Prime Minister Imran Khan rejected the Ogra summary. However, it said that the prime minister advised increasing the price of petroleum products up to Rs4 per litre in order to meet the target of the petroleum levy agreed with IMF.

Finance Ministry further said that sales tax on petrol and diesel had already been. adjusted downwards compared to December 16 to keep the oil prices lower.

 The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had proposed a reduction in prices of petroleum products by Rs 8 to 10 per litre, Ogra had recommended Rs10.77 and Rs7.73 per litre reduction in the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD), respectively.

However, the government slashed the price of petrol and HSD by Rs 5, kerosene oil by Rs 7, and light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs7.1 per litre.

After the reduction, the new price of petrol has come down to Rs 140.82, HSD to 137.62, kerosene oil to Rs109.53, and LDO to Rs107.06 per litre.

Petrol is used in motorcycles and cars. Consumers in Punjab were already using imported gas. The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) had also suspended gas supply to CNG stations in Sindh and Balochistan.

HSD is widely used in transport and farm sectors. Kerosene oil is used in remote areas for cooking where LPG is unavailable. LDO is used in industries. The government has increased General Sales Tax (GST) on petrol by Rs4.07 per litre from Rs 2.34 per litre (1.63%) to Rs 6.41 (4.77%).

Similarly, the dealer margin on petrol has been increased by Rs 0.99 per litre. The oil marketing companies' (OMC) margin has been jacked up by Rs 0.71 per litre.

On HSD, the government has decreased its price by Rs 5 per litre only and adjusted the remaining in the GST and petroleum margin. The GST on HSD has been increased by Rs 1.19 per litre from Rs10.49 per litre (7.37%) to Rs 11.68 per litre (9.08%).

Similarly, the dealer margin on HSD has been jacked up by Rs 0.83 per litre. The OMC margin has been hiked by Rs 0.71 per litre.

Shortly before the announcement, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Political Communication Dr Shahbaz Gill had tweeted that the public would soon receive ""good news"" about petrol prices.

A Finance Division handout read the government had decided to revise the existing prices ""in view of the declining price trend of petroleum products in [the] global market and transform the impact to the masses"".

The new prices will be effective from Thursday (today).

Earlier this week, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin had said that following the drop in prices in the global market, petrol prices in Pakistan would also undergo a reduction.

It may be Noted that petroleum prices in Pakistan had touched an all-time high with petrol being sold at Rs 146 per litre.

Last month, inflation sky-rocketed to 11.5% -- the fastest pace in 21 months -- because of the government's administrative decisions coupled with steep currency depreciation, which was making food, electricity and transport unaffordable for the common man.

The Consumer Price Index (CP), on a month-on-month basis, jumped 3% - the highest monthly reading in the past 13-and-a-half years, reflecting a massive increase in prices.

On November 5, the government had jacked up the prices of petroleum products by up to Rs8.14 per litre on the pretext that the earlier relief provided to the consumers had dented the fixed levy budget during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020-21 by Rs132.5 billion.

The new price of petrol was Rs145.82 per litre after an increase of Rs8.03 against the previous Rs 137.79. Similarly, HSD had risen by Rs8.14 to Rs142.62 per litre from Rs 134.48.

The government on Saturday announced a massive increase in the prices of all major petroleum products, citing soaring energy prices in the global markets in the wake of the post-Covid economic recovery worldwide.

The hike of around Rs9 to Rs12 per litre in the fuel prices of petrol, high-speed diesel (HSD), light diesel oil (LDO) and kerosene oil is bound to increase inflationary pressure on the common man, who is already facing spiralling prices of different commodities.

The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) made major increases in the prices of two petroleum products - petrol and the HSD - that are widely used by the general public. Effective Saturday, the HSD went up by Rs12.44 per litre and petrol by Rs10.49 per litre.

There had been crisis in different countries due to increase in prices of coal, gas and crude oil. Due to higher prices of coal, India had curtailed electricity supply to different states. China had also faced problem due to higher prices of coal. 

Pakistan is also producing some portion of electricity through coal as share of this fuel in power sector had increased, following imported coal-based power plants set up under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Therefore, increase in coal prices would also impact the prices of electricity in Pakistan.

On Friday, the world oil prices exceeded $85 a barrel that was the highest rate since October 2018. Pakistan being a net importer of petroleum products was directly impacted by the soaring oil prices globally.

The government announced the increase in fuel price in a statement issued by the Finance Division. Accordingly, petrol - which is used in cars and motorbikes - will now be sold at Rs137.79 per litre against the earlier price of Rs127.30 per litre.

The price of HSD - which is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors -  has been increased from Rs122.04 per litre to Rs 134.48 per litre. The price of kerosene oil went up by Rs10.95 to Rs 110.26 from Rs 99.31 and the LDO by Rs8.84 per litre to Rs108.35 from Rs99.51. The LDO is used by the industry.

The kerosene oil is commonly used at homes in far-flung areas of the country, mainly the northern parts of Pakistan. The people living in these areas use it for cooking purpose as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is not available.

After the shortage of gas, use of petrol had increased. A gas ""crisis"" is already looming over the country as the Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) and the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had failed to arrange the required LNG to meet domestic demand for the winter season.

The PLL had floated a tender to import the commodity to meet the requirements in the winter months. However, No LNG trader had participated in the bid because of the higher prices in the world markets.

Therefore, demand for petrol was likely to increase if the government curtailed the supply of gas to the CNG stations in the country. The government had already announced prioritising gas supply to the fertiliser, export sectors and domestic consumers.

The Finance Division said in the notification that at present, the world oil prices had risen to around $85 a barrel and the ""entire energy chain prices have witnessed a strong surge in the past couple of months due to higher demand for energy inputs and supply bottlenecks"".

""In the current scenario, the government has absorbed the pressure and provided maximum relief to the consumers by keeping petroleum levy and sales tax to minimum. Therefore, prices worked out by Ogra [Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority] have been approved"".

Reaction

After the government announced a massive increase in the prices of petroleum products, major political leaders and common Pakistanis were in a fit of rage over it.

Soon after the announcement, top political leaders and opposition parties condemned the government's move, demanding Prime Minister Imran Khan's resignation.

PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif termed the increase as ""utterly shameful"", saying that the latest petrol bomb will push people to the brink of starvation.

""No words to describe the extreme cruelty this selected PTI regime has inflicted on the people in the form of yet another increase in prices of items of daily use,"" Shehbaz said,

The PML-N president said PM Imran Khan has no right to remain in office and demanded his resignation.

""PM Imran's resignation could provide some relief to the nation,"" the PML-N leader said, adding that ""mini budgets"" are proof of the incumbent government's economic failures.

'Tsunami of inflation'

On the hike in petrol price, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the PTI government has brought a ""tsunami of inflation"" in the country,

""The government is actually charging people for its incompetence. During the PPP era, the burden of rising petroleum prices and products in the world market was never shifted to the masses,"" he said in a statement.

""Only PPP's people-friendly government can save the country from the tsunami of inflation,"" he added.

Bilawal said increasing the price of petrol a day after the hike in power tariff proves ""Imran Khan is an anti-people prime minister"".

Petrol is used in cars and motorbikes and is an alternate to compressed natural gas (CNG) in the country. It also increased the price of high speed diesel by Rs2 per litre.

Now, it will be available at Rs 122.04 per litre as against the previous rate of Rs120.04 per litre.

The government has also made a record increase in price of kerosene oil that is used for cooking purpose in remote areas like Northern parts of the country where Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is not available.

Its price has gone up from Rs92.26 to Rs99.31 per litre registering an increase of Rs7.05 per litre.

The government also increased the price of light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs8.82 per litre.

The petroleum products are a significant contributor to taxes as the government is currently charging a double tax. It is charging a petroleum levy and general sales tax, resulting in higher prices.

The government in a statement said that due to increase in price of oil in the international market and variation of exchange rate during the last fortnight, Ogra had worked out the higher increase in oil prices.

The new prices will come into effect from July 16 and remain unchanged until July 31.

Gill pointed out that the prices of petroleum products were increasing in the international market for the last several months. ""Ogra had proposed a hike of Rs 11.40 per litre in the price of petrol,"" he added.

Ogra had been calculating prices of petroleum products on budgeted rate of petroleum levy that stands at Rs30 per litre rather than its actual rates.

The current rate of petroleum levy is Rs21.04 per litre on petrol and Rs22.11 per litre on HSD. However, the government had a provision in the budget to charge rate of petroleum levy up to Rs30 per litre on these products.

In addition to the levy, the government is also charging 17% general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products.

During the last two and half months, the government had increased prices of petroleum products up to Rs16.37 per litre.

Since December 1, 2020, the government has increased the price of petrol by Rs 11.21 per litre, HSD Rs14.64 per litre, kerosene oil Rs 14.90 per litre and LDO Rs16.37 per litre.

The previous government of the Pakistan Muslim League- Nawaz had hiked rates of general sales tax on petroleum products. However, the federal government shares the revenue on account of GST.

Therefore, later the rate of petroleum levy was increased to receive more money that goes to the federal government, which does not share it with the provinces.

Currently, there is double taxation on petroleum products. The consumers are not only paying GST but also petroleum levy. The revenue generated through the collection of petroleum levy was meant to be spent on improving oil infrastructure like building oil storage facilities. However, it has been misused and the country did not have enough storage as exposed by the oil crisis hitting the country from time to time.

Due to lack of storage facilities, the country was unable to benefit from the dip in global oil prices.

It was an alarming situation that Pakistan had imposed a ban on import of oil due to lack of storages when other countries were importing petroleum products in bulk to beef up storages.",549.0,111.9,116.08,PM rejects increase in POL prices,0.1,0.5,0.3,0.05,0.05,0.1,0.3,0.25,0.25,0.1,0.15,0.75,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.15,0.35,0.25,0.15,1.05,-0.2,0.55,0.04999999999999999

For the third time in one month, the federal government has increased the price of petrol by Rs 2.70 per litre effective from February 1 (Monday) after the approval of Premier Imran Khan. According to a statement issued by the PM Office on Sunday, ""Prime Minister Imran approved a minimum increase in the prices of petroleum products in the interest of the public, contrary to the recommendations sent by Ogra [Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority].""

The statement added that the Ogra had recommended an increase of Rs 13.18 for petrol, Rs 12.12 for high-speed diesel, Rs 11.10 for kerosene oil and Rs 6.62 for light diesel.

High speed diesel (HSD) has become dearer by Rs 2.88 per litre, kerosene oil by Rs3.54 per litre and light diesel oil (LDO) Rs 3 per litre. The price increase came into effect from 12 midnight.

Petrol will now be available for Rs 111.90 per litre from the earlier Rs109.20, HSD will be sold for Rs 116.07 per litre as against Rs 113.19, kerosene oil Rs80.19 per litre from the earlier Rs 76.65 and LDO for Rs79.23 per litre as compared with Rs76.23.

Petrol is widely used in motorbikes and cars whereas HSD in transport and agriculture sectors. Therefore, the increase in their prices would have an inflationary impact on the masses.

On the other hand, kerosene is used in remote areas like northern parts of the country for cooking purposes where liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or sui gas is not available.

Meanwhile, LDO is consumed by industries. Consumers are paying two types of taxes, which include petroleum levy and general sales tax that play an important role in the increase in oil prices.

This is the third time the government has jacked up the prices of petroleum products in the country. On January 15, it had increased the price of petrol by Rs 3.20 per litre and HSD by Rs2.95.

Earlier, the sale of petroleum products grew in double digits in December last year following consistent revival of economic activities as major contribution came from the spike in demand for furnace oil to produce electricity during the ongoing gas crisis.
