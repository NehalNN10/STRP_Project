After PM’s approval, Nepra fixes electricity rate at  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday approved a massive reduction in electricity tariff for the industrial sector by Rs 10.69 per unit in order to boost production and exports.In view of the prime minister’s initiative, the new electricity price per unit for the industrial and export sector had now been fixed at Rs 34.99, a PM Office press release said. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) had recommended a reduction of Rs10.69 per unit for industries.“The PM’s package, which is expected to provide relief of over Rs 200 billion to the industry, will help bring down the manufacturing cost of the goods making them competitive in the global market,” the news release added. Similarly, the initiative would also help decrease the prices of agriculture commodities. “The step will likely to spur industrial growth, create new job opportunities, and stimulate economic activity,” it said.Also, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday instructed the relevant authorities to hold consultation with the globally reputed consultancy firms to realise the investment agreements with the friendly countries.The prime minister, in a meeting with a delegation of an international consultancy firm headed by former State Bank Governor Raza Baqir, also directed for consultation with the reputed firms to reduce the volume of government infrastructure and enhance effectiveness of the governance system.He told the delegation that there existed a huge potential for investment in minerals and energy sectors.Appreciating the key role of the private sector in national economic development, the prime minister assured of all-out facilitation by the government for economic revival.Federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Ahad Khan Cheema, Dr Musaddik Malik, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Awais Ahmed Leghari, ministers of state Ali Pervaiz Malik and Shaza Fatima Khawaja and relevant senior officials attended the meeting.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, following the reduction in electricity prices for industries, also announced a significant cut in petrol and diesel prices by Rs 10.20 per litre and Rs 2.33 per litre respectively.Earlier on June 1, the government had announced to cut the petrol price by Rs 4.74 per litre while that of HSD by Rs 3.86 per litre, a PM Office press release said on Friday. The incumbent government has so far provided a massive relief of overall Rs 35 per litre in petrol, it added.Meanwhile, the finance division in a statement said that the prices of Petroleum products have seen a mixed trend in the international market during the last fortnight. The Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has worked out the consumer prices, based on the price variations in the international market. The prices of Motor Spirit & HSD for the next fortnight, starting from 15th June, 2024, are accordingly being, said the statement.Following the reduction of Rs 10.20 per litre the price of Petrol will come down to Rs 258.16 per litre from the existing Rs 268.36 per litre. Similarly, the price of HSD will go down to Rs 267.89 per litre from the existing Rs 270.22 per litre following a reduction of Rs 2.33 per litreThe Federal Government is currently charging Rs 60 per litre Petroleum Levy on both Petrol and HSD. Currently, no General Sales Tax is being charged on Petrol and HSD.The government revises the petroleum products prices twice a month, on the last day and 15th of every month, however this time the announcement for the price revision was made one day ahead of the schedule date.The new oil prices will be effective from June 15, 2024,till further revision.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) Friday approved a hike of Rs 5.72 per unit in base electricity tariff, which will burden the electricity consumers by an additional approximately Rs600 billion during the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.The decision will jack up the average base tariff from the existing Rs29.78 per unit, during 2023-24, to Rs 35.50 per unit, for the upcoming FY, effective from July 1, 2024.In its decision in the matter of request filed by CPPA-G for Power Purchase Price Forecast for the FY 2024-25, NEPRA said that the total Power Purchase Price of XWDISCOs for the FY 2024-25, (after excluding the share of KE), works out as Rs3,277.506 billion, which includes Rs.1,161.257 billion for fuel & variable O&M cost and Rs.2,116.250 billion as capacity charges including UoSC of NTDC & PMLTC and MoF of CPPA-G. The capacity charges translate into Rs.6,957/kW/month, based on projected average monthly MDI of 25,348 MW. Thus, the capacity charges work out as around 65% of the total projected PPP of XWDISCOs, whereas energy cost is around 35% of the total projected PPP. In terms of average per unit PPP of XWDISCOs on unit purchased basis i.e. before adjustment of allowed T&D losses of XWDISCOs, capacity charges work out as Rs. 17.66 per unit, whereas energy charges are Rs.9.69 per unit, totalling to Rs.27.35 per unit for the FY 2024-25.According to the decision, the national average power purchase price works out as Rs27 per unit.Following the increase in average PPP, the average base electricity tariff will go up to Rs 35.50 per unit from the existing Rs 29.78 per unit. The new base tariff will be effective from July 1, 2024, and it will burden the electricity consumers with an additional Rs 600 billion during the Fiscal 2024-25.The power regulator in a decision said that it observed that CPPA-G has projected growth under three scenarios: 3%, 5%, and 10%. However, actual demand during the last two years, FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24, has shown negative growth. For the FY 2022-23, the overall generation was reduced by around 10% compared to FY 2021-22. Similarly, for FY 2023-24 (projected to June 2024), total generation has shown a slight decrease of around 1.5% compared to FY 2022-23. Additionally, KE’s electricity share from the National Grid is assumed to increase to 11,030 GWh during FY 2024-25. Therefore, XWDISCOs’ demand would be growing at a rate less than the overall rate assumed by CPPA-G in the report.Furthermore, as per the IMF data mapper report, GDP growth is projected to increase to 3.5% for FY 2024-25, compared to 2.38% for FY 2023-24 (National Accounts Committee meeting of 21.05.2024), with inflation also expected to decrease significantly in FY 2024-25.Although the improved economic situation may lead to additional electricity consumption, the Authority considers the demand growth of 5% and 10% assumed by CPPA-G as ambitious and unlikely.Therefore, considering past trends, GDP projections for FY 2024-25, and other economic indicators, the Authority has decided to accept a demand growth of 3% for FY 2024-25, including the impact of energy to be procured by DISCOs through bilateral contracts.The exchange rate parity significantly impacts electricity prices in Pakistan.Power sector costs are generally tied to dollar indexation, and any change in exchange rate parity directly affects the energy and capacity charges of the generation segment, constituting over 90% of the total cost of the power sector. CPPA-G has projected PKR/USD at 275 and 300 under different PPP forecast scenarios.The power regulator noted that the prevailing exchange rate as of June 2024 is around Rs279/USD. Although the Pakistan rupee has shown stability over the past few months, it remained above Rs. 280/USD on average during FY 2023-24, peaking at Rs. 297/USD in September 2023.Historically, over the past 15 years, PKR has devalued by around 10% per annum against the USD and may exceed Rs. 300/USD if the same trend continues. Given these facts, the Authority considers CPPA-G’s projection of an exchange rate parity of Rs. 300/USD for FY 2024-25 reasonable.During the public hearing, APTMA and FPCCI submitted that the industry was not consulted for constructing demand scenarios, and CPPA-G has not specified the underlying basis for assuming 3-5% demand growth, especially considering the decrease in power consumption.Industrial contribution to GDP has been contracting since FY 23, with little growth expected, mainly due to agriculture, which is shifting towards solarization of tube-wells. Consequently, the demand growth scenarios are unrealistic and will result in high quarterly tariff adjustments throughout the next financial year. They said that the assumed exchange rate (1 USD = 275) is problematic, as the USD to PKR exchange rate has consistently been above this for over a year, with further devaluation expected.Similarly, the assumption of 12.20% inflation is weak and requires further sensitivity analysis, as inflation is likely to increase with expected exchange rate devaluation and subsequent energy price increases. They further said that the assumptions about RLNG pricing must be revisited considering long-term LNG contracts and downward trends in global oil prices, as the long-term contracts of 1000 MMCFD are indexed to international oil prices.The instant decision of the Authority is hereby intimated to the Federal Government for filling of uniform tariff application in terms of section 31 of the Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997.","Government cuts petrol price, hikes power tariff",258.16,267.89,0.0521470457315444,0.2191803902387619,0.0842888951301574,0.5443722009658813,0.1000114753842353,0.1507134437561035,0.2547838687896728,0.1592577397823333,0.2961562573909759,0.1390886008739471,negative,0.0,0.268,0.732,0.12205683439970016,0.2961115539073944,0.22687415778636932,0.20101794600486755,0.15393951535224915

Under the biweek­ly price adjustment mechanism, the review was due on Monday (July 31), however, the government was reluc­tant, owing to upward trends in the interna­tional oil market and depreciation of Paki­stani rupee against the US dollar, and, there­fore, delayed the an­nouncement for one day till August 1, 2023.In his short tele­vised address on Tues­day morning, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar an­nounced the massive hike taking the price of Petrol to Rs272.95/litre and High Speed Diesel to Rs 273.40/litre.While explaining the reasons behind the delay in the announcement of the revised oil prices, the finance minister said the ba­sic reason was that they were looking at if there were ways to reduce the proposed in­crease. The government had checked the working of Oil and Gas Regulatory Authori­ty (OGRA) until the late Monday night.The minister said that the price of high speed diesel (HSD) and petrol had in­creased over the last 15 days in the inter­national market.In the current fortnight, petroleum prod­ucts prices in the international market have increased substantially. Petrol price has increased from $89.14 per barrel on 16th July 2023 to $97.39 on 31st July 2023, whereas, High Speed Diesel price has in­creased from $96.26 to $111.46 per barrel. Ishaq Dar said that the matter was then discussed with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif earlier Tuesday.“We all know that we have internation­al commitments with the Internation­al Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the pe­troleum development levy, if they weren’t there then we would’ve announced a small­er hike,” Ishaq Dar said and added that “We are in IMF programme, everyone knows we have a standby agreement.” If you remem­ber, the problem in the previous govern­ment tenure was that they didn’t fulfil their international commitments with IMF on Petroleum Levy and had reduced it at the time of their departure, he recalled.“So in the country’s interest, it is neces­sary that the minimum calculated hike be passed on to the consumers. HSD is being increased by Rs19.90/litre and the new price will be Rs273.40/litre. And petrol price is being increased by Rs19.95/litre to Rs272.95/litre,” Dar said.“However, international prices are not in the government’s control. And as I said, we did the working to the last penny to reduce the increase in the prices,” he said.Meanwhile, Finance Division in a state­ment said that the cost of petroleum prod­ucts in Pakistan is directly linked to the international prices of these products.

However, the government would once again take tough deci­sions including increas­ing petroleum levy, power and gas tariffs under the new SBA. Fi­nance Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday has an­nounced to maintain the petrol prices after in­creasing petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre, taking it to Rs55 per litre. The PDL on petrol has been imposed from the start of the new fiscal year, i.e. July 1 (Saturday).Moreover, the min­istry said there would be no increase in the development levy on high-speed diesel (HSD), which is Rs50 per litre. Finance minis­ter has announced that diesel prices had been increased by Rs7.50 for the next fort­night; however, he said petrol pric­es would remain the same. “There has been no increase in the price of petrol,” said Dar in a late-night press conference. The government would also increase the electricity and gas tariffs. The government would in­crease the electricity tariff by Rs3 to Rs4 per unit to fulfil the conditions of the IMF. Earlier, Federal Minister for Finance Ishaq Dar had announced in National Assembly that the govern­ment will generate a further Rs215 billion in new taxes and cut Rs85 bil­lion in spending to control the fiscal deficit for the next fiscal year. The government made the announce­ment after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the Global Financing Summit in Paris. Last week, Pakistan had also fulfilled another condition of the In­ternational Monetary Fund (IMF) for getting much needed loan tranche as State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Mon­day had increased the interest rate by one percent to 22 percent.It is worth mentioning here that in February-March this year, the gov­ernment had met all prior actions of the IMF including a mini bud­get. The government has taken all tough decisions including increas­ing power and gas prices massive­ly and imposing new taxation mea­sures worth Rs170 billion. All these measures had resulted in increase in inflation rate, which had touched highest ever 38 percent level in May 2023. Later, Pakistan had accepted two more conditions. The govern­ment, on the IMF demand, has im­posed a surcharge of up to Rs3.23 per unit on electricity consumers across the country from July 1. The State Bank of Pakistan has also increased the interest rate on the direction of the IMF. However, these decisions were not enough to satisfy the Fund as it had asked for sharing external financing plan. The government had shared its plan of getting financial assistance from friendly countries including China, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Saudi Arabia and the UAE have informed the IMF about the financing facility they have extended to Pakistan. Sau­di Arabia confirmed to provide $2 billion to Pakistan, and the UAE con­firmed to provide $1 billion.

The minister said in order to help the poor cope with the rising inflation, the government had also proposed Rs 40 billion increase in the budget of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). “The government has proposed to increase the BISP budget from Rs 360 billion to Rs 400 billion, by allocating additional funds of Rs 40 billion to benefit the (BISP) beneficiaries,” he added. He said the government also proposed to impose a 20% or Rs 50,000 (whichever is higher) tax on one business or a first-class air ticket, besides proposing a 10% advance tax on the bills of marriage ceremonies.It was also suggested to increase the Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cigarettes, and sugary drinks, whereas, on cement, the duty was raised from Rs 1.5 per kg to Rs 2 per kg, he added.Ishaq Dar made it clear that during the talks, the IMF had expressed satisfaction with the performance of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and hoped that the revenue collection target set for the year 2022- 23 would be achieved easily.The additional proposed tax measures of Rs 170 billion, he added, were not meant to bridge the gap of the collection target, rather the same would help minimise the budget deficit for the FY23. He said the IMF was much concerned over the huge losses, such as the power sector was facing losses of around Rs 1,400 billion per year. From 2013 to 2018, the PML-N (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz) government was fully focused on reducing the power circular debt. But due to the poor economic policies of the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) government, the circular debt jumped from Rs 1,148 billion in 2018 to Rs 2,467 billion now.The (incumbent) government had revised down the circular debt for FY23 from Rs 855 billion to Rs 336 billion, he added.Ishaq Dar said due to the reforms being taken by the government, the economy would first get stabilized and then witness rapid growth in the coming years. Resultantly, “income of the people will increase, rupee value will stabilize, and fiscal deficit and current account deficit (CAD) will reduce” and the country’s gross domestic product would grow by 4% in the next fiscal year (2023-24), he added. He said the issue of Letters of Credit (LCs) would be resolved soon which would help increase the exports.The minister said the prime minister had recently announced the historic Rs 2,000 billion Kissan Package, under which Rs 1,000 billion had been released so far. Similarly, he added, under the Youth Loan Scheme, the government would provide Rs 30 billion to the youth during the current year.In the Information Technology sector, the minister said, the government had allowed those earning foreign exchange in Pakistan to keep 35% of their total income in their foreign exchange currencies. The step would help increase the inflow of foreign remittances from the IT sector from $2.5 billion to over $4 billion per year.Ishaq Dar said Pakistan needed a ‘charter of economy’, for which all the political leaders should get together and vow to play role in strengthening the economy irrespective of their party affiliations. “A future roadmap should be determined to bring the economy out of crisis,” he added.Meanwhile, the federal government late Wednesday night increased the prices of petroleum products to a historic high in a bid to appease the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for unlocking the critical loan tranche, hours after unveiling a tax-loaded ‘mini-budget’. The new prices will come into effect from Wednesday’s night, a press release from the Finance Division read.The price of petrol has been moved up to Rs272 per litre after an increase of Rs22, the division said, noting that the surge has taken place due to the rupee’s devaluation against the dollar. The price of high-speed diesel has been increased to Rs280 per litre after a hike of Rs17.20. Kerosene oil will now be available at Rs202.73 per litre following a Rs12.90 hike.

Dar said that the increase is being done immediately on the recommendation of the oil and gas regulatory authority (OGRA).According to OGRA, there were reports of artificial shortages and hoarding of fuel in anticipation of price hike, hence this price rise is being done immediately to combat the artificial shortage, he added.
